In the autumn of 744 , he met Li Bai ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as " the most significant formative element in Du Fu's artistic development " because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li Bai was already a poetic star . We have twelve poems by Du Fu that refer to Li Bai . 

Du Fu's early poems are mostly about love , and he wrote some very fine poems in the style of the Tang court . But the style he preferred was the style of Li Bai , who was known for his free verse and his unconventional views . Du Fu wrote a number of poems on the subject of ghosts . These are unusual for a Chinese poet of the Tang era , and suggest a strong interest in Buddhism . In a number of poems he referred to the Taoist immortal , Han Xiang . He also wrote poems about travel , and the mountains and rivers of China . 

In 746 , Du Fu went to the capital . There he had a chance meeting with the reclusive poet Wang Wei . They became friends , and Wang Wei invited Du Fu to his home . It was a visit that was to be significant for Du Fu's poetry . Wang Wei was a poet of the wilderness , and his influence on Du Fu was to be a major factor in the development of his own distinctive style .

Du Fu's poetry shows the influence of the Tang dynasty poets , but also the influence of earlier poets such as Li Bo and Cao Zhi . He was also influenced by the Buddhist poets of the Tang era , such as Han Yu and Meng Haoran . In his later poems , Du Fu often used colloquial language . This was a technique that was rare in Chinese poetry , but it was a technique that Du Fu used very effectively . He was a master of the Chinese short poem , or ci , and was also a master of the Chinese four-line poem .

 The situation in the North China Plain was especially chaotic , with countless rebel groups springing up . In 757 , the rebels even managed to take the capital Chang'an . 


 The rebellion was eventually suppressed by the new Emperor Daizong , who succeeded his father Emperor Suzong in 762 . The suppression was led by Emperor Daizong's cousin , who was made Prince of Qin and later became Emperor Dezong . 


 The imperial government soon took measures to deal with the many rebel groups in the North China Plain , and by 764 , the situation was relatively stable . 


 Emperor Daizong died in 779 , and his brother Emperor Dezong succeeded him . He was the son of Emperor Xuanzong 's consort Yang Guifei , and was thus a member of the Tang royal family . He had little experience in state affairs , and was influenced by his senior adviser Yang Guozhong .

### Self-reflection

Hawkes points out that the "comic triviality" of Du Fu's life, as he sees it, does not preclude the possibility that he may have been aware of it, or that he may have even been amused by it. This would be in keeping with the fact that Du Fu was known for his self-deprecating humor.

Du Fu's self-reflection is an important part of his poetry. He often writes about his own failures and shortcomings, and how they have led to his suffering. He also writes about the suffering of others, and how he wishes he could do more to help them.

Du Fu's self-reflection is often seen as a sign of his humanity and compassion. He is able to see himself and others with empathy, and he is not afraid to show his vulnerabilities.

> may have been composed over a period of months . This variety is also displayed in his use of language : he seems to have been able to master any poetic form , yet he is also capable of producing poems which are so rich in metaphor and imagery that they are quite unlike anything written by his contemporaries . In the second half of the 11th century , however , the general trend in poetry was away from the fluidity and subtlety of the earlier period , towards a more rigid and formal style . Wang Anshi was one of the poets who reacted against this trend , and he was also one of the few who was able to revitalise the earlier forms of poetry . His verse has been described as " the only poetry in the history of Chinese literature which can be said to have reached the highest level of the traditional forms " . He seems to have been particularly skilled in the use of the Shih and Quan shi forms . One of the best known examples of his work is his poem " The Dongting Lake " , which was written in the Quan shi form . This poem is a good example of the way in which Wang Anshi was able to use the traditional forms to create new , original poetry . The poem is about Wang's love for a woman called Yang Jia , and it is full of references to the natural world , which is used as a metaphor for the emotions of the speaker . The Dongting Lake , which is a large lake in central China , is described as being " like a beautiful woman " , and the poet compares his own emotions to the changes of the seasons . This poem is one of the few examples of the Quan shi form which has survived from the Song dynasty , and it is also one of the few examples of Wang Anshi's work which has been widely anthologised . In the late 11th century , however , there were other poets who were equally skilled in the use of traditional forms , and they were also able to create new , original poetry . One of these poets was Su Shi , who is often regarded as the greatest poet of the Song dynasty . He was born in 1036 , and he died in 1101 . Su Shi is known for his use of the Chou form , and he is also known for his use of the Quan shi form .

> pped a more personal style of writing . The two most important poems in this style are " Mount Lu in Spring " and " Departure after Ten Years " .

Chou also notes that the composition of Du Fu's poems changed in the last decade of his life . In the first decade he wrote 1610 poems with an average of 2.5 lines per poem . In the second decade he wrote 909 poems with an average of 2.4 lines per poem . In the last decade he wrote 278 poems with an average of 2.8 lines per poem .

### The poetry of the Three Kingdoms

In 1979 , the Chinese scholar Zhang Wenjin argued that the poems of the Three Kingdoms (220–280 CE) were similar to the poems of the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE) . He pointed out that the poems of the Three Kingdoms were written in the same styles as the Tang poems, that they used the same themes and that they were written by the same people . He also pointed out that the poems of the Three Kingdoms were not written in the same literary forms as the poems of the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) . In 1996 , the Chinese scholar Zhou Guoquan argued that the poems of the Three Kingdoms were similar to the poems of the Tang Dynasty in style and content . In 1999 , the Chinese scholar Feng Youlan argued that the poems of the Three Kingdoms were written in the same styles as the Tang poems and that they used the same themes . In 2002 , the Chinese scholar Wang Shiwei argued that the poems of the Three Kingdoms were written in the same styles as the Tang poems and that they used the same themes . In 2003 , the Chinese scholar Liu Xinhua argued that the poems of the Three Kingdoms were written in the same styles as the Tang poems and that they used the same themes .

In 1323 , the Song Dynasty poet and historian Su Shi , known as Su Dongpo , wrote a memorial to the Emperor Huizong , who had died in 1132 , praising Du Fu and recommending him for imperial patronage . Su's memorial led to the Emperor Gaozong's decision to commission an official collection of Du Fu's works . 

The first complete collection of Du Fu's poems was published in 1325 , during the Yuan Dynasty , and it was expanded and republished many times over the next six centuries . 

The publication of Du Fu's works during the Yuan Dynasty was followed by the publication of collections of his works during the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty . These collections , which were compiled by scholars and bibliophiles , are the most valuable sources of information about the poems that Du Fu wrote during his lifetime . 

In the 19th century , the German sinologist Karl Friedrich Neumann , who was the first Westerner to write about Du Fu , said that Du Fu's works were " without any doubt the greatest poetic monument of China " . In the 20th century , the French sinologist François Jullien said that Du Fu's works were " the most important poetic works in Chinese literature " . 

### Early life and career

Du Fu was born in Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan , on 7 July 712 , during the Tang Dynasty . His father , Du Chong , was a minor official in the Chengdu administration , and Du Fu was the only child of his marriage to Du Zhen . His mother was a member of the Li family . Du Fu's father died when Du Fu was ten years old , and his mother remarried to Du Fu's uncle , Du Shen . Du Fu's uncle also died when Du Fu was a teenager . 

In 730 , Du Fu began his studies at the prefectural school in Chengdu . After graduating from the school in 736 , he was appointed to a minor post

> that Du Fu's reputation became firmly established. This was in part because of the publication of his poems in the monumental anthology New Collection of Old Poems ( 新舊詩選 , Xīnjiù Shī Xuǎn ) , compiled by Su Shi and Lu You . It was also because of the growing popularity of his poems among the literati . By the end of the 11th century , Du Fu's reputation was so great that his poems were often used to illustrate moral lessons in the works of other poets .

### Eight Dynasties

During the Eight Dynasties period (907–960), Du Fu's reputation remained strong, but he was also criticized by some. The famous Tang poet and critic Bai Juyi (772–846) wrote a poem criticizing Du Fu's early poem "Weaving" ( 織 , Róu ), in which he complained that Du Fu had not paid enough attention to the aesthetics of the poem.

Du Fu was also criticized for his use of vulgar language, such as his use of the word "fart" in the poem "The Farting Buddha" (鳴佛 , Míng Fó). This poem was published in the anthology New Collection of Old Poems.

### Song Dynasty

The Song dynasty (960–1279) saw a renewed interest in Du Fu's poetry. The poet and critic Su Shi (1037–1101) published a long piece of prose, The Biography of Du Fu (杜甫傳, Dù Fǔ Zhuàn), in which he criticized Du Fu for his failure to adhere to the Confucian virtues. He also wrote a piece defending Du Fu from the criticisms of Bai Juyi.

### Yuan Dynasty

The Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) saw the publication of the first biography of Du Fu written by a non-literati writer, the official and poet Wang Rong (1284–1357). Wang Rong's biography was published in 133

 Hegel 's philosophy was in large part a reaction to the Enlightenment and the French Revolution , which he saw as having failed to live up to their own ideals . Hegel believed that the Revolution had been successful in liberating the individual , but had failed to achieve the kind of community in which individuals could live together in harmony . Hegel believed that the Revolution had failed to achieve this because it had not understood the true nature of freedom . Hegel believed that freedom was not simply the absence of constraint , but rather the ability to live in accordance with one 's own nature . Hegel believed that this was only possible in a community in which individuals were able to understand and respect each other 's differences .

### Critical reputation

Du Fu is widely regarded as the greatest poet in the Chinese language and one of the greatest in the world. His works were admired by Li Bai , another major Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty. A 12th-century commentator, Su Shi , considered Du Fu to be the greatest poet of his era and the greatest poet of all time. Du Fu's works were also admired by the Ming dynasty poets Wang Anshi , Lu You , and Mei Yao-ch'en. In the 20th century, he was the favourite poet of the American poet Kenneth Rexroth , who has described him as "the greatest non-dramatic, non-epic poet who has survived in any language."

### Poetic style

Du Fu was a master of the shi form , which he frequently used in his poems. However , he also wrote many songs ( sheng ) and ballads ( yue ) in addition to shi , and he also wrote essays ( jian ) and letters ( wen ).

The first part of Du Fu's poem "The Lonely Tower" ( lü shui ) is an example of a shi , and it is one of the most famous poems in the Chinese language. In this poem , Du Fu writes of his feelings of sadness and loneliness as he contemplates the past and his uncertain future. The second part of the poem is an essay , and in it Du Fu expresses his views on the importance of poetry and his own poetry in particular.

The first part of "The Lonely Tower" is a good example of Du Fu's use of the shi form. The poem consists of five lines , and each line has five characters . The first line begins with the word "lü" , which means "lonely" or "sad" , and the second line begins with the word "shui" , which means "water" or "rain" . The third line begins with the word "shan" , which means "mountain" or "hill" , and the fourth line begins with the word "ling" , which means "tower" or "turret" . The fifth line begins with the word "shang" , which means

> which are included . Hawkes is on the other hand in the main a literal translator , whose concern is to preserve the <unk> as closely as possible .
The first point to be made about the Chinese poems in this volume is that they are not in fact a hundred . The title is misleading , and Rexroth himself was aware of this ; it is the title of a collection which he edited in the United States in 1956 .
The second point is that Rexroth 's translations are not in fact free . He has sought to render the Chinese idiom in English as closely as possible , but the result is not a free rendering of the Chinese idiom , but a literal rendering of the English idiom . The aim is to make the poems read as if they were written in English , and the means are to leave the Chinese idiom intact and to translate the English idiom into it .
The third point is that the translation of a poem is inseparable from the translation of the reference it makes to other poems . Rexroth has taken it for granted that the reader will know the other poems and the other references , and has therefore omitted many of the latter from his selection . This is an unacceptable criterion for a translation , since the translator cannot be sure that his reader will have the same prior knowledge as himself .
The fourth point is that Rexroth 's translations are not poems in their own right . They are literal translations of the Chinese poems , and the latter are therefore not poems in their own right either .
The fifth point is that Rexroth 's translations are not poems in their own right , but translations of Chinese poems . They are therefore not poems in their own right , but translations of Chinese poems .
The sixth point is that the Chinese poems are not poems in their own right . They are translations of poems in their own right , but are therefore not poems in their own right .
The seventh point is that the Chinese poems are not poems in their own right , but translations of poems in their own right . They are therefore not poems in their own right , but translations of poems in their own right .

The first lady's office said Obama would be speaking with the president of Turkey, Abdullah Gul, on Tuesday to "reaffirm the strength of the U.S.-Turkey partnership, and discuss the situation in Syria."
The United States and Turkey are at odds over the conflict in Syria, where a two-year civil war has killed more than 70,000 people and driven more than 2 million refugees into neighboring countries.
The Obama administration has been reluctant to arm the rebels, fearing the weapons could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-affiliated groups.
Turkey, however, has been calling for the West to provide weapons to the rebels.
Obama's call with Gul came as the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg, Russia, for talks on the Syria crisis.
Erdogan has been vocal in his criticism of the Syrian government and has said the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, should leave office.
The Syrian government has accused Turkey of supporting the rebels.
The first lady's office said Obama and Gul would also discuss women's issues, including the empowerment of women and girls in the Middle East and North Africa.
In the interview with Vogue, Obama said she was "particularly excited" to be traveling to Turkey with the first lady of Turkey, Emine Gul, in June.
"I am looking forward to going to Turkey, because I think it's one of the most important countries in the region," she said. "They're a NATO ally. They're a Muslim country. They're a country that's been a leader in the Middle East and North Africa, and they're a country that's very, very close to the United States."
The first lady said she would be traveling to Turkey with Gul, who is the first lady of Turkey, for a "working visit."
"It's a very important country," Obama said

### Critical reception

"Love Me Like You Do" was met with a mixed critical reception. In a review for Idolator, Robbie Daw praised the song, writing that it "sounds like a cross between 'Love Is Blindness' and 'Love Is a Losing Game'", and that it "builds upon the chemistry that was so apparent on the duo's first single, 'Can't Feel My Face'." However, he added that "the song's pulsing beat, pounding percussion, and shout-along chorus" is "too familiar" and that it "might feel like a step in the wrong direction." Daw also noted that the song "is a definite grower" and that it "may be a little too dizzying at first, but with repeated listens, the addictive nature of the song's beat and hook will likely win you over." In a review for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis called the song a "soggy disco-pop anthem", and wrote that it "sounds like a drunken couple dancing at a wedding disco", and that it is "the sort of song you'd want to hate but can't, because it's so ridiculously catchy." He added that the song "has a great tune, but it's the sort of tune you can't remember the lyrics to, or indeed remember what the lyrics are about."

> The Ise class was the first Japanese dreadnoughts. They were designed as a response to the US Navy's battleship building program of the early 1920s, and the two ships were built in parallel. The Ise was laid down in May 1916 and launched in June 1917, and the Hyūga in May 1917 and launched in August 1918. Both ships were completed in September 1918.

Lead ship of the Hiryu class of aircraft carriers , Akagi was built in Kawasaki ' s Kobe shipyard and launched in 1927 . She was the first aircraft carrier in the IJN to be powered by turbines and was the only one of the early IJN aircraft carriers to have an island superstructure .
After service in the 1930s , Akagi was refitted with an armored flight deck , a revised flight deck layout , and a second catapult . This allowed her to operate a second air group of floatplanes . Following the start of the Pacific War , she was reassigned to the South China Sea . During the Battle of Midway , she was struck by US bombers , and was later sunk by US torpedo bombers .
Following the end of the war , Akagi was scuttled by the IJN in 1946 .
Akagi was 216 meters ( 709 ft ) long at the waterline and 225 meters ( 738 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 22.5 meters ( 74 ft ) and a draft of 7.4 meters ( 24 ft ) . Displacing 19,200 long tons ( 20,000 t ) , she had a metacentric height of 1.38 meters ( 4.5 ft ).
Akagi had a crew of 1,236 officers and enlisted men .
Akagi was powered by four Parsons geared turbines , each driving one propeller shaft . The turbines were designed to produce 95,000 shaft horsepower ( 71,000 kW ) , allowing the ship to reach speeds of 35 knots ( 65 km/h; 40 mph ) . She carried 2,750 metric tons ( 2,710 long tons )

 The design of the Fusō class was an evolution of the earlier Kongō class . The primary change was a significant increase in main armament caliber from 12-inch to 14-inch guns . The Fusō class also incorporated a number of other changes intended to improve protection and maneuverability . In addition , the Fusō class was designed to be a bit faster and more seaworthy than the Kongō class . The Fusō class also incorporated an innovative internal design for the magazines , which were designed to be self-sealing . This was intended to prevent explosions similar to those that occurred in the battleships HMS Vanguard and HMS Hood .

### Naval diplomacy

Japanese naval diplomacy during this period was designed to counter the threat of Russian expansion into Korea and Manchuria . The Japanese navy was incapable of dealing with the Russian Pacific Squadron , and its ships were too small to protect Japanese interests . The Japanese navy had been designed to defend the Japanese home islands from a Russian invasion , and not to protect the empire . The Japanese government therefore sought to strengthen the navy through diplomatic channels . In 1904, the Japanese government proposed a naval agreement with Britain , under which the British Admiralty would guarantee the safety of Japanese interests in Korea and Manchuria , and Japan would allow the British Royal Navy to use the port of Kobe . The British government refused the proposal , citing the need to maintain the balance of power in the Pacific . The Japanese navy was further handicapped by a lack of funds . 

The government of Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi had sought to modernize the navy in the 1890s , but the cost of this modernization was a burden on the government and on the Japanese economy . The Japanese government therefore sought to place the burden of naval modernization on the British , and the British government agreed to provide financial assistance to the Japanese navy . In 1905, the two nations signed the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of London , in which Britain agreed to pay 2.5 million pounds to Japan for the construction of a fleet of eight modern battleships and eight cruisers . The Treaty of London also contained an agreement for the two nations to cooperate in the event of war between Japan and Russia . 

The Japanese government believed that the Treaty of London would help it to achieve its goal of a "Greater East Asia " policy , which would include the annexation of Korea

They were named after the provinces of Yamashiro and Hizen .

> ng to be approved , was hampered by a series of problems . The first problem was the underwater protection . The ship's designers initially planned to use a traditional armored hull , but the IJN was reluctant to adopt such a design . This was due to the fact that the underwater protection of armored battleships had been shown to be ineffective during the Russo-Japanese War . 


 The IJN instead opted to adopt a water-tight double bottom . The designers intended to incorporate this design into the Fusō class , but the IJN had not yet adopted this design into their fleet . As a result , the IJN ordered the construction of the first ship in the class to be halted until they could decide whether the ship would be built with a traditional hull or a water-tight double bottom . Fusō 's construction was halted in March 1913 , and the IJN ordered the ship to be rebuilt with a water-tight double bottom . 


 During this time , the IJN ordered the construction of the Ise and Hyūga classes . These ships were similar to the Fusō class , but incorporated the water-tight double bottom design . 


 The Fusō class had an overall length of 188.1 meters , a beam of 26.6 meters , and a draft of 8.6 meters . The ships had a design displacement of 24,500 metric tons . 


 The Fusō class ships were armed with a main battery of eight 46-centimeter guns in four twin turrets . Their secondary battery consisted of ten 14-centimeter guns and eight 7.62-centimeter anti-aircraft guns . The ships were also equipped with four 450-millimeter torpedo tubes . 


 Fusō , Yamashiro , and Ise were powered by four sets of Parsons geared steam turbines . The turbines drove four screw propellers and were designed to produce a total of 40,000 shaft horsepower . The ships could reach speeds of 21 knots .

 Sandwich plating is a type of armour plating that consists of two layers of different metals. The inner layer is a mild steel, while the outer layer is a harder steel or a non-ferrous metal, such as nickel or stainless steel. The inner and outer layers are bonded together with a third, softer layer in the middle, which forms a composite plate that is much stronger than either of the two individual layers. Sandwich plating was first used in the 1860s, and was employed on warships of many navies during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
IJN Fusō class battleships
The Fusō class were the first battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). They were laid down in 1910, and entered service in 1914, shortly after the start of World War I. They were the first Japanese battleships to be built in Japan, rather than in the United Kingdom. The ships were designed to counter the threat of the Russian Pacific Fleet, and were armed with a main battery of four 305 mm (12 in) guns. They were slightly larger than the preceding Kongō class, and were the first Japanese battleships to be designed with a uniform speed of 21 knots (39 km/h; 24 mph). The ships were built in Japan, which was intended to demonstrate Japan's growing naval power and technical prowess.
The ship's main armament consisted of four 305 mm (12 in) guns in two twin turrets, one fore and one aft of the superstructure. The guns had a range of 22,000 metres (24,000 yd), and were supplied with a total of 1,000 rounds of ammunition. The guns were mounted in a central pivot mounting with a maximum elevation of 15°, and could fire two rounds per minute.
The secondary armament consisted of twelve 140 mm (5.5 in) guns, which were mounted in casemates in the superstructure. These guns had a range of 18,500 metres (20,200 yd), and were supplied with a total of 1,800 rounds

### World War II

The Yamato class was designed to support the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN) amphibious operations in the Pacific. The Yamato-class battleships were intended to conduct operations from the coast of China, Taiwan, and the Philippines, rather than from Japanese home waters. The Japanese high command considered the battleships to be essential to the success of their amphibious operations. The Japanese planned to use the Yamato class battleships in a pre-emptive strike against the United States Navy (USN) fleet anchorage at Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands. They believed that the Japanese navy could not afford to lose a single battleship and were afraid of an American invasion of the Japanese home islands.

The Yamato-class battleships were never used in the planned pre-emptive strike against Ulithi Atoll, as the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ) refused to authorize the operation. The Yamato-class battleships were used in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During the battle, Yamato was sunk by air attacks from the USN Seventh Fleet, while Musashi was sunk by USN submarines.

The conversion was accomplished at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal between August 1943 and March 1944 . The ships were armed with a single 127 mm/40 Type 89 AA gun on a platform atop the rear turret . The ships were completed as carriers by mid-1944 and commissioned as IJN carriers with hull numbers 250 and 251 . The ships were not considered particularly successful as carriers , and they were returned to the IJN's battleship force after the war . The IJN never carried out any other conversions of battleships to carriers , and none of the three ships of the Ise class were commissioned as carriers .
The Yamato class was the first class of battleships to be completed for the IJN since the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , and they were the largest battleships ever built in the world . They were the only battleships commissioned by the IJN during the war . They were designed as a follow-on to the Yamato class , with the IJN expecting to build a total of eight battleships in the class . However , the war ended before the fourth ship could be completed , and the third ship was cancelled in 1944 .

> ary and confusion. The goal was to force the UN and ROK forces to either withdraw from the battlefield or surrender.
The North Koreans underestimated the capabilities of the ROK and UN forces and the ability of the forces to quickly regroup and counter-attack, as well as the resiliency of the ROK forces to continue to fight , despite the horrific casualties suffered. The North Koreans also underestimated the aggressiveness of the ROK forces and the willingness of the UN forces to fight to the death, which the North Koreans expected to be easy prey.
This is the first volume of a three part series.
The North Koreans launched a massive invasion of South Korea in June 1950, seeking to reunite the country under the communist banner. The UN and ROK forces were not prepared for this sudden assault and were quickly forced into a defensive posture. The North Koreans were able to gain the initiative, and the UN and ROK forces were forced to retreat to the Pusan Perimeter, which was a narrow and relatively short strip of land along the southeastern coast of the Korean peninsula. The North Koreans launched a massive offensive to force the UN and ROK forces to surrender or withdraw from the battlefield.

The Battle of Inchon was a successful amphibious invasion and capture of the city of Inchon by United Nations forces under the command of U.S. General Douglas MacArthur on September 15, 1950, during the Korean War. Inchon, on the west coast of South Korea, was a key to the success of the subsequent Incheon Landing Operation, which led to the ousting of North Korean forces from the Seoul area and the re-consolidation of South Korean forces.
The Incheon Landing Operation was conducted by the United Nations Command (UNC) and South Korean forces, and is considered a turning point in the Korean War.
The operation was planned by MacArthur with the assistance of United States Navy Admiral Arthur W. Radford and the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. MacArthur's superiors in Washington, D.C. — President Harry S. Truman and Secretary of State Dean Acheson — had initially opposed the plan, but the President was overruled by his national security advisers. The operation was carried out by the Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) and United States Navy (USN) amphibious forces, with additional support from the ROK Army and U.S. Army units. The Incheon Landing Operation was the largest amphibious assault since World War II.
The Incheon Landing Operation began on September 15, 1950, when the U.S. 7th Fleet landed troops of the X

The Dramatic Story of the Battle of the Bulge

The Dramatic Story of the Battle of the Bulge Book Excerpt:
The Battle of the Bulge, the most famous battle of World War II, as seen through the eyes of the soldiers who fought it. The Battle of the Bulge was Hitler's last gamble, the desperate offensive to split the Allies, to recapture the vital port of Antwerp, and to force the Allies to the negotiating table. Launched on December 16, 1944, the German offensive caught the Allies completely by surprise. The weather was so bad that Allied intelligence believed the Germans were not preparing for an offensive. The Germans were ready, however, and within days the Allies found themselves in a fight for their lives. The Allies were forced to fight a war of movement for the first time since D-Day. The Germans had the initiative, and the Allies had to fall back before the German advance. The Germans, however, were making a fatal mistake. They had concentrated all their forces on the Ardennes. They had left the Allies' flanks wide open. The Americans, in particular, were ripe for counterattack. And counterattack they did. In less than three weeks the Allies had driven the Germans back across the Ardennes, a feat of arms unparalleled in modern military history. The D-Day of the Battle of the Bulge was December 23, 1944. In the days that followed, the Germans were driven back to the Rhine, and the Allies began to recapture ground lost in the disastrous summer of 1940. In the Ardennes, the Allies had won a great victory, but the war was far from over.

## Battle

### Background

Following the First Battle of Naktong Bulge , the Pusan Perimeter was expanded to include a front of 100 miles (160 km) . The perimeter was held by the US 1st Cavalry Division and US 2nd Infantry Division , with the US 24th Infantry Division in reserve . The 1st Cavalry Division was defending the northern side of the perimeter , with the 2nd Infantry Division defending the southern side . The US 24th Infantry Division was also defending the southern side of the perimeter , but was not involved in the battle .

### North Korean forces

The North Korean forces in the battle were from the 6th Infantry Division . The division was commanded by Major General Lee Eung-jo . The division's commander of 30th Regiment, Colonel Lee Chae-yeon , was awarded the Order of Kim Il-sung for his actions during the battle .

### Battle

The Battle of Pohang-dong was fought from 19 August to 25 August 1950 . The battle was a battle of attrition , with the North Koreans launching repeated attacks against the Pusan Perimeter , which were repulsed by the Americans . The battle was one of the final engagements of the First Battle of Naktong Bulge . The battle resulted in the North Koreans suffering heavy casualties , and the Pusan Perimeter being secured .

The Battle of Pohang-dong began on 19 August 1950 , when the North Koreans launched an attack against the Pusan Perimeter . The attack was repulsed by the Americans , who suffered 27 casualties . The attack was the first of a series of attacks launched by

and the North Korean 15th Division at the Battle of Old Baldy , were able to block the North Korean 4th Division from advancing further south , and to push back the North Korean 6th Division . 

## Background

On August 24, 1950, after a month of heavy fighting, the North Korean army invaded South Korea, crossing the 38th parallel. The invasion was a surprise to the United States and the United Nations, which had sent a small number of troops to Korea to aid the South Korean Army. The North Korean Army, called the Korean People's Army (KPA), consisted of about 95,000 men, 4,000 tanks and 4,500 artillery pieces, while the United Nations forces consisted of only about 40,000 men. The North Koreans had complete air superiority, and also had 100,000 men in reserve.

The North Koreans rapidly advanced, reaching Seoul, the capital of South Korea, in less than two weeks. The South Koreans were not able to stop the North Koreans, and by the end of August, the North Koreans had occupied most of South Korea. The United Nations troops retreated to Pusan, the last remaining South Korean city, and prepared to defend it.

## Battle

On September 1, the North Koreans began their final offensive to capture Pusan. The North Koreans attacked from the north, northwest, and south, and the United Nations troops were able to hold them off. The North Koreans were unable to break through the defenses of the United Nations troops, and the Battle of Pusan Perimeter ended on September 18.

## Aftermath

The North Koreans were unable to capture Pusan, and the United Nations troops were able to prevent them from advancing further south. The Battle of Pusan Perimeter is considered a major turning point in the Korean War, as it allowed the United Nations to regroup and prepare for their eventual counter-offensive.

 Ironclads were built in a variety of sizes . A large number of the first ironclads were small and used for coastal defense . These ships were typically built with a shallow draft to facilitate them operating in coastal waters and estuaries . Many of the later ironclads were much larger and were designed for offensive operations against enemy coasts . These ships were built with a deeper draft and were designed to be able to operate in the open ocean .

 Ironclads were constructed in a variety of ways . The earliest ironclads were built with a wooden hull and a iron plate armor . In the 1870s and 1880s, ironclads were built with a steel hull . In the 1890s, ironclads were built with a steel hull and a steel armor . In the 1900s, ironclads were built with a steel hull and a cement armor . In the 1910s, ironclads were built with a steel hull and a cement armor . In the 1920s, ironclads were built with a steel hull and a cement armor .

 Ironclads were armed in a variety of ways . The earliest ironclads were built with a single armament . In the 1870s and 1880s, ironclads were built with a single armament . In the 1890s, ironclads were built with a single armament . In the 1900s, ironclads were built with a single armament . In the 1910s, ironclads were built with a single armament

 Springing from the same technological roots as the ironclad , the pre-dreadnought battleship was the first warship to be protected by armor instead of wooden @-@ hulls . The first pre-dreadnought was the British HMS _Bacchante_ , which was laid down in 1876 . The first of the pre-dreadnoughts that would become known as the Ironclad Battleships was the British HMS _Dreadnought_ , laid down in 1875 and launched in 1879 . The Dreadnought was armed with 4 12-inch ( 305 mm ) guns and protected by 12 inches of iron armor . In the United States , the first pre-dreadnoughts were the USS _Massachusetts_ and USS _New Jersey_ , launched in 1883 . The first pre-dreadnought to be built by the German Navy was the SMS _Kaiser Friedrich der Grosse_ , launched in 1897 . In 1906 , the term "dreadnought" was coined by the British admiralty to refer to the revolutionary design of the HMS _Dreadnought_ , which was the first all-big-gun battleship to combine a uniform main armament with armor protection . The HMS _Dreadnought_ was laid down in 1905 and launched in 1906 . It was the first battleship to be powered by steam turbines , which made it faster than the pre-dreadnoughts .
Six battleships were built to the Dreadnought design , but they were soon outclassed by the new battleship design . The term "dreadnought" became synonymous with "battleship" , and the term "pre-dreadnought" was used to refer to older battleships .
Dreadnoughts were built by all major navies until the First World War . The first of these new battleships was the USS _New York_ , which was launched in

> ships were simply called " armoured ships " .

The term " ironclad " was originally used for a type of warship designed to protect wooden ships from the threat of torpedoes and other explosive devices . This was a significant threat during the 19th century , when ships were built primarily of wood . Steam power was introduced during the 1830s , and by the mid-1840s, steam-powered torpedoes were being used in combat .

 Ironclads were the first class of naval vessel to be designed specifically to withstand the threat of explosive devices , and they were a revolution in naval warfare . The first ironclads were armed with guns mounted in iron casemates , which were armoured to protect the guns and their crews . The first ironclads were built by the British Navy in the mid-1850s .

 Ironclads were followed by the pre-dreadnought battleship , which was a larger and more heavily armoured version of the ironclad . Ironclads and pre-dreadnoughts were followed by the dreadnought , which was a revolutionary design that incorporated many of the lessons learned from the ironclad .

In 1859, Napoléon was used to escort a fleet of merchant ships to the Crimean War , but was not used for combat . She was used again in 1862 , this time to escort a fleet of warships to the Second Opium War , where she was used to fire on the Taku Forts and was hit by a Chinese shot . 

In 1864, Napoléon was converted into a training ship . In 1880, she was sold to the Russian Navy as a training ship , where she was renamed Tsarevna . She was returned to France in 1907 and scrapped in 1910.

## Lave

The ironclad floating battery Lave was built at the Thames Iron Works in 1854. She was launched on 11 June 1854 and completed on 21 August 1854. She was 218 feet (66.4 m) long, had a beam of 36 feet (10.97 m) and a draught of 8.5 feet (2.6 m). She had a displacement of 1,350 long tons (1,370 t).

The battery was fitted with two 15-inch (381 mm) and four 6-inch (152 mm) guns.

### Service

Lave was commissioned in 1855 and served in the Crimean War. She was sent to the Sea of Azov where she was attached to the French Navy's Black Sea Squadron . She served with the squadron until 1856.

Lave was sold to the British Navy in 1856 and renamed HMS Cochrane . She was renamed HMS Prince Consort in 1860.

### Fate

Prince Consort was broken up in 1866.

The first British ironclad , HMS Warrior , was a 900-ton ship with a 26-foot (8.0 m) draught and a top speed of 12 knots . The Warrior was armed with four 12-inch (300 mm) guns in two twin turrets and had 600 yards (550 m) of 12-inch armour on her side . The French ironclads had been designed to meet the same specifications . Gloire and Magenta were 950 tons and 27 feet (8.2 m) draught , and had 650 yards (590 m) of 12-inch armour on their sides , but had a top speed of 11 knots .

### Construction

Gloire was ordered on 14 June 1862 , and Magenta on 13 July . Gloire was laid down at the Chantiers de la Loire shipyard in St. Nazaire on 15 October 1862 . She was launched on 22 July 1864 . Magenta was laid down on 15 October 1863 , and launched on 21 July 1865 . The two ships were similar in most respects , but Gloire was slightly larger .

### Armament

Gloire and Magenta were armed with four 12-inch (305 mm) muzzle-loading guns in twin turrets , and two 8-inch (203 mm) muzzle-loading guns in pivot mounts . The guns were 5.5 metres (18 ft) long and weighed 5,600 kilograms (12,300 lb). The guns fired 240 kilograms (530 lb) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 440 metres per second (1,400 ft/s) .

; The most important of these was the ram CSS Virginia , built in secrecy in Norfolk, Virginia. When the ship was launched in March 1862 , it was christened the USS Merrimack . The Merrimack had been a wooden warship , but was raised from the seabed after the Union blockade of the Confederate coastline cut off the shipyard from its supply of new timber . The ship was raised , refitted with iron plates , and rechristened the CSS Virginia . It was not the first ironclad ever built , but it was the first one to see action. 

 The first ironclad battles were fought between the Virginia and the USS Cumberland and USS Congress . The Confederates won a major victory in the Battle of Hampton Roads , sinking two Union ships and badly damaging a third . This success encouraged the British to build ironclads . 

 The first of the British ironclads , the HMS Warrior , was launched in 1860 . The Warrior was 9,000 tons , with an iron hull and a crew of 600 men . It was armed with 10 guns , and had a speed of 12 knots . The ship was not built for battle , and was more of a demonstration of what the future held . The Warrior was used for training and as a flagship until 1870 . 

 The first ship built specifically for battle was the HMS Black Prince . The Black Prince was launched in 1861 . It was smaller than the Warrior , with a displacement of 5,000 tons . It was armed with 11 guns , and had a top speed of 14 knots . 

; The first ironclad built for the French Navy was the Gloire , launched in 1858 . The Gloire was 5,000 tons , with an iron hull and a crew of 300 . It was armed with 20 guns , and had a top speed of 11 knots . The Gloire was a single-turreted ship , which allowed the crew to better defend against ramming attacks . The Gloire was used in the Baltic Sea during the Crimean War .

 Ironclads were first used by the Union in the Battle of Hampton Roads , Virginia , on March 8 , 1862 , when the wooden frigate USS Cumberland was sunk by the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia , the former USS Merrimack . Virginia was the first ironclad to engage in battle , and the first ironclad to sink an enemy ship (the wooden frigate USS Congress , which she rammed and sank ). 

 After the Confederates captured the ship , they raised her and rebuilt her as CSS Virginia . She was the first ironclad ever built , and the first to be sunk . The next year , the Union Navy launched the ironclad USS Monitor , the first to be built from the keel up . 

 The Monitor and the Virginia engaged in the first battle between two ironclads , at Hampton Roads on March 9 , 1862 . 

 The Monitor and the Virginia were similar in size and armament , but the Monitor 's low profile , with its gun turret exposed only 18 inches (460 mm) above the surface , made it a unique vessel. The Virginia , on the other hand, was a converted wooden frigate , with a tall superstructure and guns that were only partially protected by armor . 

 The Virginia was powered by steam , while the Monitor was powered by two screw propellers driven by a steam engine. The Virginia was armed with a 10-inch (254 mm) gun , while the Monitor carried two 11-inch (279 mm) guns . 

 The battle lasted about three hours , and ended with neither side scoring a decisive victory. Both ships were badly damaged , but neither was sunk. The Monitor was unable to leave the battlefield for repairs, so the Virginia was able to escape. 

 The Monitor and the Virginia fought again in the Battle of Hampton Roads on May 9, 1862 . The Virginia was again damaged , and this time she was unable to escape. The Monitor was badly damaged and had to leave the battlefield. The

> she engaged the wooden Union frigate USS Cumberland . The wooden ship was sunk with heavy losses to the Union crew . 

 The first ironclad built by the Union Navy , the USS Monitor , entered service in January 1862 , and was well received by the Union public . 

 The Battle of Hampton Roads between the Monitor and the CSS Virginia in March 1862 was the first battle between two ironclads , and the first naval battle of the Civil War . 

 The Battle of Mobile Bay in August 1864 was the last major naval battle of the Civil War , in which the ironclad USS Tennessee engaged the CSS Tennessee . 

 The ironclads of the Union Navy proved to be superior to those of the Confederacy , although the Confederacy's ironclads were more numerous . 

## Background

### Naval tactics before the war

During the 1850s , the United States Navy was small and relatively weak . Its principal ships were large wooden sailing frigates such as the USS Constitution and the USS United States , with a few smaller sailing frigates such as the USS Brooklyn and the USS Cumberland . 

 The United States Navy had a small fleet of steam powered frigates , including the USS Mississippi and the USS Macedonian . 

 The United States Navy had a few ironclad warships , including the USS Dahlgren and the USS New Ironsides . 

 In the 1850s , the Union Navy focused on the coast of North America , while the Confederacy focused on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea . 

 In the 1850s , the Union Navy's main targets were the Barbary pirates and the slave trade , while the Confederacy's main targets were the British and the French . 

 In 1861 , the United States Navy was commanded by Commodore Samuel Francis du Pont , and the Confederate Navy was commanded by Commodore Franklin Buchanan . 

 The Union Navy had a total of 10 ships , and the Confederate Navy had a total of 15 ships . 

 In 1861 , the Union Navy had a total of 12,000 sailors , and

> war , the Union and Confederate navies engaged in a series of battles , most of which were indecisive , though the Union's victory at the Battle of Mobile Bay resulted in the fall of Mobile , Alabama . During the war , the Confederate navy launched a number of attacks on Union shipping , including the raid on Port Royal , South Carolina and the raid on Alexandria , Virginia .

## Union Navy

The Union Navy was created by the United States Congress on July 13, 1861. The U.S. Navy was already in existence, but this was the first time the U.S. Congress officially declared the Union Navy to be a separate service. The Union Navy was under the command of the Secretary of the Navy, which was first held by Gideon Welles and later by Welles' assistant, William Dennison. The Union Navy was divided into the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The North Atlantic Blockading Squadron was commanded by Admiral David Dixon Porter , who was responsible for the blockade of the major southern ports of the Atlantic coast. The West Gulf Blockading Squadron was commanded by Rear Admiral David Farragut , who was responsible for the blockade of the major southern ports of the Gulf Coast .

### Battleships

The first ironclad battleship commissioned into the Union Navy was the USS Monitor . She was ordered on December 29, 1861, and launched on January 30, 1862. The Monitor was designed by John Ericsson and was built by the Continental Iron Works in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The Monitor was designed to counter the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia . The Monitor's design was revolutionary, as she was the first ironclad warship designed to have a rotating turret and the first ironclad warship to have a revolving gun turret. The Monitor's design was based on a French design for a turreted steam ram .

The first ironclad ship built for the Union Navy was the USS New Ironsides . She was ordered on December 21, 1861, and launched on January 23, 1862. The New Ironsides was built by the Continental Iron Works and designed by John Ericsson. The

The ironclads of the American Civil War were a class of warships that used iron or steel armor to protect their wooden hulls from enemy firepower. They were a major development in warship design from the first ship of the class, the CSS Virginia, which was commissioned by the Confederate States of America in 1861. The Virginia, originally a Union Navy frigate, was rebuilt with iron armor over the wooden hull, which was then filled in with coal. The Virginia was a success in battle, and spurred the Union to build ironclads of their own.

## Background

The American Civil War was the first conflict in which ironclads played a major role. Before the war, ironclads had been built in Europe, but only as small vessels of little importance. The ironclad, however, became a decisive factor in the war.

## Construction

The ironclad's armor was usually made of iron plates or rails riveted together, though some ironclads used wrought iron. The armor was generally 2 to 3 inches thick, but some ironclads were built with as much as 6 inches of armor. The armor was typically placed over the hull of the ship and extended down to the waterline.

The ironclad's armor was usually supported by wood frames, but some ironclads used iron frames. The armor was usually riveted to the frames, but some ironclads used screws or bolts to attach the armor to the frames. The armor was usually made of iron plates or rails, but some ironclads used wrought iron.

 One of the most successful vessels used by the Western Flotilla was the USS Conestoga , which was one of the few ironclads to survive the war . It was the first ironclad built by Eads and was the first ironclad built on the Mississippi River . The Conestoga was built in 1862 and was used in the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863 . It was first used in the Yazoo Pass Expedition , in which it was able to pass through the Yazoo Pass and open the Mississippi River to the Union fleet . It was the first ironclad to pass through the Yazoo Pass , and it was the first ironclad to pass through the Yazoo River .

## Construction

The ironclads were designed by Lieutenant Commander John L. Worden , USN , who was also the captain of the ironclad USS _New Ironsides_ . The ironclads were designed as lightly armored monitors , and were considered to be the fastest of their type at the time . The ironclads were designed to be able to go up and down the rivers of the Mississippi valley , and to be able to navigate the shallow Mississippi River Delta .

## Operational history

The ironclads were assigned to the Western Flotilla and served in the Mississippi River . The ironclads were involved in a number of battles , including the Battle of Memphis , the Battle of Grand Gulf , the Battle of Vicksburg , the Battle of Helena , the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou and the Battle of Arkansas Post .

 The Austrians were also outnumbered by the Italians in the wooden fleet , but they had the advantage of having a better position , being closer to the Italian fleet . 

 The battle began at 05:45 on 20 July , when the Austrians attempted to break the Italian blockade . In the first phase of the battle , the Italian ironclads were forced to retreat , but they managed to regroup and re-engage . The Italian ships, superior in speed , maneuverability , and firepower , succeeded in breaking the Austrian battle line and destroying the Austrian fleet . The Austrian flagship, Tegetthoff , was the only ironclad to survive the battle . 

 The battle of Lissa was one of the first naval battles to be fought by ironclads , and the first to be won by an ironclad fleet . It was also the first battle in which the ironclad Tegetthoff participated . 

## Background

In 1866 , the Kingdom of Italy , which had been established only in 1861 , had not yet acquired a navy . The first Italian fleet was built in 1867 , and consisted of six ironclads and four wooden ships .

The first Italian ironclad frigates were the "Risorgimento" class , launched in 1868 , and the "Affondatore" class , launched in 1869 . The first ironclad frigate built in Italy was the "Affondatore" , which was launched in 1869 and named after the "Affondatore" class ironclad frigates built in France and launched in 1860 . The "Affondatore" was designed by the French engineer Émile Bertin , who also designed the first ironclad frigate built in France . 

The Italian fleet was initially built to protect Italian merchant ships from attacks by the Austrian fleet . In 1866 , the Kingdom of Italy declared war on the Austrian Empire , and the

The 1880s saw the advent of modern torpedo boats , as well as the first battleships and cruisers armed with explosive shells . The first modern destroyer , the British HMS Swift , was launched in 1884 , and the first torpedo boat , the German S14 , was commissioned in 1886 . The first modern battleship , the British HMS Victoria , was launched in 1887 . 

 The first battleships of the 1880s were all designed as armored frigates . They were smaller than the armored frigates of the 1870s , but their armor protection was thicker . The first battleships of the 1880s were armed with 12-inch guns . 

 The first torpedo boats were small , open-decked boats armed with a single torpedo . They were only effective against small craft , such as torpedo boats and minesweepers . The first destroyers were larger , more heavily armed , and faster than the torpedo boats of the 1880s . The first destroyer , HMS Swift , was armed with two 1-pounder quick-firing guns , two 3-pounder quick-firing guns , and two torpedo tubes .

## History

### Early use

The first recorded use of a ram as a weapon of war was at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, where the Persian fleet was attacked by the Greek ships and driven back by the Greeks' ramming tactics.

During the Middle Ages, ships were often fitted with battering rams on the prow to break into the enemy's hull.

The most famous example of the use of a ram as a weapon is the Battle of Lake Poyang, fought in 823 between the Chinese Tang Dynasty and the Chinese-allied Qin. The Tang fleet used large wooden rams on the prows of their ships to break through the Qin armor, and the Qin fleet was defeated.

### Age of Sail

Ramming tactics were used by the Vikings in the 9th century. The Vikings used their longships as a means of transporting troops, so ramming was a tactic they used to take over other ships. They were also used in naval battles against other longships.

In the 17th century, the ramming tactic was used by the Dutch, French, English, and Spanish.

The English Royal Navy used the tactic at the Battle of Tory Island in 1641, and at the Battle of Barfleur-La Hougue in 1692. The Dutch used the tactic in the Battle of the Gabbard in 1653, the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665, and the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1781. The French used the tactic at the Battle of Tory Island, and the Battle of Dogger Bank. The Spanish used the tactic at the Battle of San Juan de Ulúa in 1568, and the Battle of San Lorenzo in 1592.

In the 18th century, the French Navy used the tactic at the Battle of Dogger Bank, and the Battle of Ushant. The Spanish used the tactic at the Battle of Havana in 1762, and the Battle of Hav

> er the ramming tactics effective became a matter of intense debate .

## Ramming and the development of armor plate

During the 1860s, the Union navy experimented with a number of ramming ironclads . However, the best results came from the ramming tactics of the Monitor , which was equipped with a ram of 268 pounds (121 kg) of steel and 1,500 pounds (680 kg) of iron . The Monitor rammed and sank the Confederate ironclad C.S.S. Virginia in 1862 .

The Union Navy then built a series of ships with similar designs . However, these ships had weak armor that could not protect them from Confederate ironclads . When the Monitor was sunk by the C.S.S. Virginia, the Union Navy turned to ironclad designs that were protected by thick iron plates .

## Ramming and the development of submarines

Ramming had a significant effect on the development of submarines . In 1862, the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley , which had a 1,500-pound (680 kg) iron ram, rammed and sank the Union ironclad U.S.S. Housatonic . However, the H.L. Hunley was destroyed in the process . 

The H.L. Hunley's ram was later used as a model for the Union ironclad U.S.S. Tecumseh . The Tecumseh's ram was used to ram and sink the ironclad C.S.S. Virginia . However, the Tecumseh was destroyed in the process . 

Ramming was also used by the Union submarine C.S.S. H.L. Hunley .

## Ramming and the development of destroyers

Ramming had a significant effect on

367
> ire of the opposing ship . 

 The earliest guns had to be loaded by hand and the guns could only be fired when the ship was stationary . 

 This was a major problem for ironclads , which could not manoeuvre as quickly as wooden warships . 

 

 In 1873 , the French inventor Victor Hugues developed a gun which could be fired while moving at high speed . 

 This type of gun was used in the armour-clads of the French Navy from 1878 , but it had the disadvantage of being highly vulnerable to counter-fire . 

 

 The next major advance in naval guns was the development of the breech-loading gun . 

 The breech-loading gun was invented by Sir William Armstrong in 1854 . 

 The breech-loading gun was far more accurate than the earlier muzzle-loading guns , but was less powerful , and the loading mechanism was very complex . 

 The first breech-loading guns were used on the British warship HMS Hector in 1860 , but they were not adopted by the British Navy until 1868 . 

 The first breech-loading guns to be used in action were the 15-inch (380 mm) guns of the French ironclad La Gloire , which were used in the Battle of Lissa in 1866 . 

 The first breech-loading guns to be used in a major battle were the 16-inch (410 mm) guns of the French ironclads Courbet and Henri IV in the Battle of Lissa in 1866 . 

 The first breech-loading guns to be used by the Royal Navy were the 16-inch (410 mm) guns of HMS Devastation in the Bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 . 

 

 The first breech-loading guns to be used by the United States Navy were the 10-inch (250 mm) guns of USS New Ironsides in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba in 1898 . 

 

 The first breech-loading guns to be used by the Russian Navy were the

> d proved ineffective in combat against rifled guns .

### Armor

The primary purpose of armor was to protect the hull of the ship from enemy fire . Armor was made up of iron and steel plates that were riveted or bolted to the hull . 

 The ironclad HMS Warrior was the first ship to have iron armor plates riveted to the hull . Her armor consisted of a 1.5 inch ( 38 mm ) belt running the length of the ship .

### Propulsion

The first ironclads were propelled by a variety of means . Steam was the preferred method of propulsion . Early ironclads were often propelled by a single propeller driven by a single steam engine . 

 Later ironclads such as HMS Warrior were propelled by twin screws driven by two separate steam engines . The twin screw arrangement was adopted to enable the ship to reverse while underway . 

### Sailing rig

Many ironclads were also fitted with sailing rig . Sailing rig was initially fitted as a secondary means of propulsion . Later, ironclads were fitted with sails as a means of saving fuel . 

 HMS Warrior was fitted with a single sail which was used as a secondary means of propulsion .

### Steam propulsion

Early ironclads were propelled by steam . Steam was generated by a boiler , the hot gases from the boiler were piped to a steam engine . The steam engine was connected to a screw propeller via a shaft . 

 The first ironclad to be powered by steam was the US Navy's USS Monitor . Monitor was built in 1862 and was commissioned in 1862 . Monitor was powered by a single steam engine driving a single screw propeller . 

 The first ironclad to be powered by twin steam engines was the French ironclad Gloire . Gloire was built in 1858 and was commissioned in 1859 . Gloire was powered by twin steam engines driving a single screw propeller . 

### Electric propulsion

Electric propulsion was used on the Japanese ironclad Fuji .

369
> further development was made of the idea of loading guns from the breech , but the Warrior 's guns led to the development of the quick loading 12-inch /35 Mark IX and Mark X guns for the Royal Navy . 

### Warrior 's influence

The Warrior was the first British ironclad warship to be built with the screw propeller , which had been invented by Robert Fulton in 1804 but had not been widely adopted in naval applications . The Warrior was also the first warship to be fitted with an Armstrong breechloading gun . 

The Warrior was followed by a series of British and French ironclads with screw propulsion and breechloading guns , including the French Gloire and La Guepard , the British Black Prince , Devastation , and Shannon , and the French Redoutable and Tonnant . The Warrior and the Gloire were both designed by Cowper Phipps Coles .

The Warrior was the first ironclad warship to be sunk in battle , by a mine laid by the German ironclad SMS Scharnhorst in 1871 . The Warrior was also the first ironclad warship to be salvaged , by the Royal Navy .

### Sinking

The Warrior was sunk in 1871 by a mine laid by the German ironclad SMS Scharnhorst . The Warrior was raised and then sold for scrap .

### Salvage

The Warrior was the first ironclad warship to be salvaged , by the Royal Navy . The Warrior was raised in 1885 , and then sold for scrap .

### Warrior Class

The Warrior Class was a class of four British pre-dreadnought battleships . The Warrior Class was the first class of British pre-dreadnought battleships to be built with breechloading guns , and the first class of British pre-dreadnought battleships to be built with the screw propeller . The Warrior Class was also the first class of British pre-dreadnought battleships to be built with compound steam engines .

> of leakage of the explosive gas .

The explosive gas may be propelled out of the front of the breech , or it may be driven back into the gun . The latter situation is known as a flash-back , and is extremely dangerous . In addition , if gas is forced back into the breech , the gun barrel is at risk of being destroyed . 

 A further problem was the delay between the time when the breech is closed and the time when the charge is fired . This is known as the time of flight of the breech . The delay was often considerable . If the gun is being fired quickly , then there is a risk of the breech being opened before the charge has been fired . The consequence of this is a breech explosion . 

 The gun which suffers from these problems is the typical breech loader . The American Civil War saw the first widespread use of breech loaders , and the problems were soon recognized . 

 The solution to the problem of sealing the breech was to have the gun loaded from the side . This is known as the side-loading gun . The problems of sealing the breech were largely solved by having the breech face the side of the gun . 

 The problems of sealing the breech were not the only problems which affected the breech loader . The other problems of breech loading were not solved by the side-loading gun . The problem of the time of flight of the breech was not solved . 

 The other problems of breech loading were solved by the advent of the box magazine . The box magazine was an arrangement whereby the cartridges were loaded into a box which was then closed by a bolt . The box magazine was used on the box magazine rifle . The box magazine was also used on the Maxim gun . 

 The box magazine was invented by Hiram S. Maxim in 1883 . Maxim was a British engineer who was born in the United States . He had been a major supplier of revolvers to the United States military .

The main armament of the British Mark II and Mark III tanks was four QF 6-pounder guns . This weapon was a derivative of the QF 3-pounder gun , which had been used in World War I as the main armament of light tanks . The 6-pounder was not a particularly good anti-tank gun ; it had a muzzle velocity of only 1,800 ft/s ( 550 m/s ) and the 1.5 in ( 38 mm ) armor penetration of its shells was inadequate . The 6-pounder could, however, be fired from a platform at the front of the tank , which gave it a range of 4,300 yards ( 3,900 m ) . The 6-pounder was also used as the main armament of the Mark IV and Mark V tanks .
 The Mk. VI had a short barrel which was only 11 calibres long, the Mk. VIB had a longer barrel of 14 calibres.

### Muzzle-loading artillery

The muzzle-loading artillery was a type of artillery which used a matchlock or wheel lock to ignite the propellant charge in the barrel of the gun. The guns were loaded by lowering the breech of the gun down into the chamber and loading the charge and projectile. The charge was lit by the gunner and the projectile was fired. The muzzle-loading artillery was developed in the 14th century and remained the dominant type of artillery until the introduction of the rifled cannon in the 1850s.

Muzzle-loading artillery was used in the Siege of Constantinople (1453), and in the Hundred Years' War. The first use of artillery in the United States was in the Siege of Boston, and the first use of artillery in the American Revolutionary War was at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

### Muzzle-loading rifles

Muzzle-loading rifles were developed in the 17th century. They were the precursors of the rifled guns which were developed in the 1850s. Muzzle-loading rifles were used in the American Revolutionary War, the Napoleonic Wars, and the American Civil War.

> ion . Another was to use the new chemistry of nitrocellulose (or "guncotton") , which was more stable and slower burning . This allowed the use of longer barrels , and greater accuracy .

Another major improvement was the invention of the explosive shell , which was a hollow metal ball filled with an explosive charge . This was first used in the American Civil War , and proved to be a major advantage in naval warfare . In order to be effective , the shell had to be able to withstand the force of the explosion . A major problem was the amount of time it took for the shell to reach the target . Shells fired from a rifled gun could be accurate for up to 1,500 yards (1,400 m) . Shells fired from smoothbore guns had a maximum range of about 3,000 yards (2,700 m) . To make the shell more accurate , a rifled shell was used , but this reduced the range to about 1,000 yards (910 m) . As a result , the first shells were used as a means of attacking the enemy's guns .

One major problem with shells was the fuzes used to set off the explosives . Early shells were set off by a small fuse , which had to be lit before the shell could be fired . This was a major problem , as the fuse had to be lit and the shell fired before the target was reached . The first major advance in fuzes was the "time fuze" , which was set to explode at a certain time after the shell was fired . The first time fuze was invented by William G. Congreve , and was first used in the 1820s . In 1846 , an improved version was developed by Henry Shrapnel , and became known as the "shrapnel shell" . The shrapnel shell was very effective , and was used by both sides during the American Civil War .

Another major advance was the use of shrapnel . Shrapnel was a type of shell containing a large number of small metal balls . These were designed to explode in mid-air , and the balls were designed to be as lethal as possible . Shrapnel was first used by the British in 1804 , and became the

 A major development in naval warfare was the introduction of the torpedo in 1863 . In 1877 , the French Navy introduced the first practical naval mine , which was essentially an explosive charge attached to a hollow iron tube . The tube was lowered into the water , and when it struck the bottom , the explosive charge detonated , causing the tube to sink to the bottom , and then be exploded by a clockwork mechanism .

 The first armored cruiser was built in 1890 . Armored cruisers were a class of ships that had been designed to combine the speed of a cruiser with the armor protection of a battleship . Armored cruisers were built throughout the 1890s , and they were the dominant warship type in the 1900s .

The barbette was an improvement on the broadside battery , whereby the guns were mounted on a turret which could be rotated . The guns could be fired at any angle, which made them very difficult to disable . 

 The turret was invented in the early 19th century , but the first to use them in war was the USS Monitor , which was designed by John Ericsson in 1861 . 

 The turret was a major innovation in naval warfare and is considered to be the first major step in the evolution of the modern battleship . 

 The first turrets were small , but as the technology improved , they became larger and more powerful . By the time of World War I , turrets were the standard way of mounting guns on warships . 

 A turreted warship is sometimes referred to as a turret ship .

## Early history

The first turreted warship was the USS Monitor , which was designed by John Ericsson in 1861 . It was an ironclad ship with a low profile and a revolving gun turret . It was the first ironclad warship built by the United States Navy and the first turreted warship ever built . The Monitor was commissioned in February 1862 and it was used in the American Civil War .

The turret's advantages were that it allowed a ship to fire broadside and point the same guns in a different direction simultaneously ; it could also fire on the same target while manoeuvring ; and it reduced the need to use deckspace for the guns themselves . The disadvantages were that it made the ship top-heavy and required a heavier armour belt , and that it limited the size of the ship .

The turret concept was adopted by the French , British , and American navies in the 1870s , and it became standard on battleships by the 1890s .

The turret was a forerunner of the modern naval gun turret .

> 1890s designers were still thinking of 19th-century technology . They did not understand that the ultimate weapon was not the cannon , but the propeller . The American Civil War had been fought on the high seas , and the ironclad was the answer to the problem of the warship's vulnerability to modern artillery . The gun had come to be the main armament of the warship , and the ironclad was designed to protect its guns . Ironclads were also seen as a means of defending the coast from enemy ships . The problem was that the speed of the ships was limited to that of the propeller , and the propeller had a power-to-weight ratio of 1 . 2 to 1 . 5 hp/ton . The ironclads had a speed of only 10 knots , and their guns were useless against fast cruisers . This meant that they were useless in battle , and that they were of little use for coast defence . Ironclads were also expensive to build . The problem of range was also solved by the introduction of the steam turbine , which was developed by the British engineer Charles Algernon Parsons . The turbine could be used for propulsion , and it had a power-to-weight ratio of 20 hp/ton . The turbine made possible the development of the large-calibre gun .

Torpedo (ship) - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_(ship)
A torpedo is a self-propelled weapon launched above or below the surface of water to detonate underwater, usually against a ship. The term is also commonly used to refer to various unguided anti-ship missiles. Historically, the first torpedoes were "dynamite fish" launched by hand, designed to destroy ships by exploding beneath the waterline. The first self-propelled torpedoes were developed in the 1860s. These were electrically powered, but they were unwieldy and dangerous to operate. In the 1880s, inventors began developing steam-powered torpedoes.

The first self-propelled torpedoes were electrically powered, but they were unwieldy and dangerous to operate. In the 1880s, inventors began developing steam-powered torpedoes. The first practical steam-powered torpedoes were developed by the Italian inventor Giovanni Luppis, who patented a steam-powered torpedo in 1864. The first steam-powered torpedo to be deployed in combat was the Whitehead torpedo, developed by Whitehead in 1866. The Whitehead torpedo was a single-shafted boat with a fixed propeller, and it was propelled by a steam engine. The Whitehead torpedo was first used in combat by the Austrian Navy in 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. The Whitehead torpedo was a success, and it was adopted by the navies of many countries. The Whitehead torpedo was the first torpedo to be used in combat, and it was the first torpedo to

> o was the first successful underwater weapon . It was a device about 15 feet (4.6 m) long and 100 pounds (45 kg) in weight , propelled by a steam engine with a 20-horsepower (15 kW) boiler . The Whitehead torpedo was controlled by a pistol firing a percussion cap that detonated a charge of gunpowder in a tube . The explosion drove a piston in the boiler , which turned a propeller . The Whitehead torpedo had a range of 200 yards (180 m) .

 The Whitehead torpedo was adopted by the British Navy in 1875 and was used in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 . In 1882 the Whitehead torpedo was used by the Royal Navy against the Egyptian fleet in the Battle of Alexandria . The Whitehead torpedo was used by the Royal Navy in the Spanish–American War of 1898 , and by the Italian Navy in the Battle of Lissa in 1896 and the Battle of the Dogger Bank in 1905 .

 The Whitehead torpedo was followed by the Gatling gun , the machine gun , and the airplane .

The first torpedo attack was made by the French against the Prussian ironclad SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse on 20 September 1870. The attack failed, and a second attempt was made on 26 September, which also failed.
The first successful use of the torpedo in naval warfare was on 20 July 1876. The British ship HMS Shah was anchored at the mouth of the Bosphorus, and the Ottoman torpedo boat Mushir-i-Mamalek made a successful attack.
The torpedo was used in the first submarine attack on an ironclad in 1878. The French submarine Gymnote was used to attack the Italian ironclad Re Umberto , but the attack was unsuccessful.
In 1882, the British ironclad HMS Shah attacked the Turkish ironclad Sultaniye with a torpedo, but the attack failed.
The first use of a torpedo against an ironclad in the Mediterranean was the attack on the Italian ironclad Re Umberto by the French submarine Plongeur on 28 August 1885.

 The first ironclad warship , the USS Monitor , was built by the United States Navy in 1862 .

The development of ironclad warships was the result of the need to improve the protection of wooden hulls against modern artillery . In the 1850s , the British Royal Navy was experimenting with iron hulls for warships . In 1859 , the ironclad warship HMS Warrior was launched . This was the first ironclad warship designed to be built with iron hulls and iron armor . The Warrior was a first-class ship-of-the-line , and was armed with 100 guns .

The first ironclad warship built by the United States Navy was the USS Monitor . The Monitor was designed to counter the ironclad CSS Virginia , which was formerly the USS Merrimack . The Monitor and the Virginia fought the first battle between ironclad warships , the Battle of Hampton Roads , in March 1862 .

### 1870s and 1880s

 The second generation of ironclad warships was the protected cruiser . The protected cruiser was a small ironclad warship , designed to be fast and maneuverable . It was designed to protect the ship against small arms fire , and to avoid damage from solid shot from large guns . The protected cruiser was more vulnerable to ramming than the ironclad battleship .

 The protected cruiser was first designed by the United States Navy . The USS Chicora was launched in 1873 . The USS Essex was launched in 1874 .

### 1890s and 1900s

And , given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were increasingly cost effective . The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough , and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bough . filled with iron , and the ironclads built in the 1860s were far more complex than their wooden predecessors .

 The later Krupp armor was 22 in ( 559 mm ) of compound armor , and 13 in ( 330 mm ) of Harvey armor . The British Navy preferred the Krupp armor and used it extensively , while the U.S. Navy used Harvey armor until the end of the decade , and then switched to Krupp armor .

 In 1895 Harvey designed a new type of armor plate for battleships and battlecruisers , which was much thinner than the earlier Harvey armor , and which was produced by the Phoenix Iron and Steel Company . The new armor was 2 in ( 51 mm ) thick , and weighed about 110 lb per sq yd ( 550 kg/m² ) . It was much cheaper than Harvey's original armor , and it was lighter , allowing for a thinner ship hull .

The new armor was tested at the Naval Gun Factory , Washington D.C. , and the tests showed that the new armor was equivalent to 12 in ( 305 mm ) of Harvey armor , and to 7 @.@ 75 in ( 197 mm ) of Krupp armor . The new armor was adopted by the U.S. Navy , and used extensively on the battleships and battlecruisers built during the 1890s .

 Iron Duke 's main battery was composed of twelve 12-inch (305 mm) Mk VII guns in barbettes . This was a relatively new arrangement, first used on HMS Dreadnought in 1906 . The guns were placed in four twin turrets on the centreline . The turrets were placed amidships and aft . They were 20 feet (6.1 m) in diameter , and weighed 1,100 tons (984 t) each . The turrets were of a new design, and were considered to be the most advanced of any warship in existence . They were designed by Sir William Armstrong , and were a significant advance on the earlier turrets used on the Majestic class of pre-dreadnought battleships . The turrets were rotated using a hydraulic system . The turrets were designed to be able to be traversed 180° , which was considered to be more than sufficient . They were also designed to be able to elevate the guns to a maximum of 15° above the horizontal . The guns had a maximum range of 19,600 yards (17,900 m) , and a rate of fire of 1.5 rounds per minute . They could also fire a 1,000-pound (454 kg) armor-piercing shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,500 feet per second (760 m/s) . The guns could be loaded in any order, and could be loaded with a variety of different projectiles .

 Iron Duke 's secondary battery consisted of twenty-two 4-inch (102 mm) Mk V guns in casemates . The casemates were arranged in four gun turrets on the upper deck , and in four single casemates on the lower deck . The upper deck turrets were placed amidships , and the lower deck turrets were placed at the ends of the ship . The turrets were placed on

### Steam turbine propulsion

Main article: Steam turbine

A turbine engine has several advantages over a reciprocating engine. It has a higher efficiency, higher power-to-weight ratio, and is smoother, quieter and more fuel efficient. Its main disadvantage is that it is more expensive to produce than a reciprocating engine.

#### Fuel-burning turbines

Main article: Gas turbine

A gas turbine is a type of turbine driven by hot gases produced by burning a fuel. Typical fuels include natural gas, propane, kerosene, aviation fuel, diesel fuel, fuel oil, methanol and coal.

The first gas turbine-powered ship was the US Navy's AKV-3 Vigilant, which was launched in 1959. The ship was designed as an anti-submarine warfare vessel. The ship used a single Rolls-Royce Olympus gas turbine engine, which was capable of producing 44,000 shaft horsepower (33,000 kW). The engine was built by the Sargent & Lundy Company.

The first gas turbine ship to be powered by two engines was the US Navy's USS Enterprise (CVN-65). The ship was launched in 1961. The ship was designed as a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The ship was powered by two General Electric LM2500 gas turbine engines. The engines were capable of producing 230,000 shaft horsepower (170,000 kW). The engines were built by General Electric.

The first gas turbine ship to be powered by three engines was the US Navy's USS Coral Sea (CV-43). The ship was launched in 1947. The ship was designed as a fleet carrier. The ship was powered by three General Electric LM2500 gas turbine engines. The engines were capable of producing 360,000 shaft horsepower (2

The steam engines of the time were not yet efficient enough to operate in tropical conditions , and it was not until the end of the 19th century that they would be . At the time , the only effective way to overcome these problems was to use a mixture of sails and steam . This combination also had the advantage that it could be used in all weathers , and was therefore suitable for use in the Mediterranean , as well as in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . The development of the ironclad had begun in the 1860s , but the first ironclad warships did not appear until 1876 . These were two ships of the Royal Navy , HMS Warspite and HMS Dreadnought . The first ironclad warship of the French Navy was the Gloire , which was completed in 1858 . The first ironclad warships of the Russian and Italian Navies were the Imperator Alexander III and the Re dent , both of which were completed in 1861 . The first ironclad warships of the Austrian and German Navies were the Kronprinz and the SMS Preussen , both of which were completed in 1867 . The first ironclad warships of the Spanish and Japanese Navies were the Pajarito and the Chiyodagata , both of which were completed in 1870 .

> / the first ironclad in the world ( La Gloire ) , the French navy was unable to build enough ironclads to counter the threat posed by the Royal Navy . 

 The first ironclads were designed to protect merchant shipping from attack by the newly created ironclad warships , but the need for this type of ship was short lived as the ironclad warships were soon outclassed by the larger & faster armoured cruisers . The ironclads were still used for their intended purpose ( to protect merchant shipping ) for the remainder of the 19th century , and into the 20th century . 

 As a result of their use in naval warfare , ironclads were soon used in coastal defence & riverine warfare . The first ironclad to be used in coastal defence was the French ironclad La Gloire , which was stationed at Bizerta in Tunisia to protect against any threat from the Italian fleet . The first ironclad to be used in riverine warfare was the French ironclad Amiral Rigault de Genouilly , which was used in the Battle of the Yalu River in 1894 . 

 As the British ironclad Dreadnought came into service , the age of the ironclad ended as the Dreadnought was the first ship to combine all of the advantages of the ironclad & the pre-dreadnought battleship into a single ship . As a result , the ironclads became obsolete . 

 The ironclad was one of the first examples of modern naval warfare . 

 The ironclad is also one of the few types of ship that has had its name borrowed by a different type of ship . 

 The use of iron in the construction of the first ironclads was not the result of any particular technological advance , but rather a result of the lack of availability of steel .

The Royal Navy had been building armored ships since the 1860s and had a number of them in service by the early 1870s .

The British suggested that the U.S. Navy build a fleet of coastal ironclads , as they had , but the U.S. Navy decided to follow the Royal Navy's lead and build ironclads that could operate in the open sea . The U.S. Navy's first such ship was the USS Dictator , built in 1882 .

 The armored ships that had been built before the war of 1859 were designed to fight each other with their large cannons and were usually built to carry a crew of 200 to 300 men . These ships were relatively large and heavy, and they had to be towed to the battlefield.

## Poem

The poem is presented as a conversation between Eliot and a ghost. The ghost tells Eliot that the end of the world is near. Eliot disagrees, and the ghost responds by saying that it is not the end of the world, but the end of the ghost's world.

The ghost's world is one in which the belief in God is "dead," and the ghost cannot believe in a God who is not present. The ghost states that the only way to reach God is through the physical, and that this is the only way to achieve salvation. Eliot responds that the ghost's world is one in which God is "dead" and that the ghost's belief in God is "dead" as well.

## Plot

The novella takes place in the 1970s and is narrated in the first person by a retired New York lawyer named Robert Littell. Littell is recruited by a New York firm to help search for a missing Nazi war criminal. He travels to South America and meets a German-Jewish businessman named Mendel , who tells him that he has been searching for Adolf Hitler for 30 years. Mendel has discovered that A.H. is living in the Amazon jungle under the name of Adolf Ludens.

Mendel describes to Littell how he came to believe that Hitler was alive in the jungle. In 1945, Mendel was a Jewish prisoner of war in a camp in Germany. He was one of a group of prisoners who were forced to dig up a mass grave in the camp. The bodies were horribly mutilated, and he was sure that the men who had committed these crimes were still in the camp. He hid a piece of paper in the grave and swore to find them.

After the war, Mendel travelled to South America in search of the men. He had hoped to find them in Argentina, but was told that they had left the country. He travelled to Brazil, and then to Venezuela, and eventually came to the conclusion that the men had gone to the Amazon jungle.

Littell travels to the jungle with Mendel and his son, Michael. They find A.H. living in a cave with a group of men who call themselves the Nazi Party. A.H. is in his 80s, but is still alive and well. Littell is shocked by the sight of A.H., and by the fact that he is still alive.

A.H. is friendly and charming, and seems to have no regrets about his past. He tells Littell that he has no intention of leaving the jungle, and that he is happy there. Littell is disturbed by this, and he begins to have doubts about whether A.H. is really the man he claims to be.

## Synopsis

The novella is divided into two parts . In the first part , " The Portage " , the narrator , a professor of English literature , visits his friend , the writer Franz Kafka , in the hospital . Kafka is dying of tuberculosis , and the narrator is at the hospital to visit him . The narrator tells Kafka that he is planning to write a book about him , and Kafka is pleased with the idea . Kafka says that he would like to write a book about the narrator , but the narrator says that this is impossible , as the narrator is " too trivial " to be worthy of a book . The narrator says that Kafka's book about him will be " the best book " he has ever written , but Kafka replies that he has never written a good book . Kafka then tells the narrator that he has decided to write a book about the narrator's father , the narrator's uncle , and the narrator . The narrator is shocked by this , and he asks Kafka why he would want to write a book about him . Kafka replies that he has decided to write a book about the narrator's father because he was the most important person in the narrator's life . Kafka also says that he has decided to write a book about the narrator's uncle because he was the only person who was not afraid of the narrator's father . Kafka then says that he has decided to write a book about the narrator because he is the only person who knows the truth about the narrator's father .

In the second part , " The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. " , the narrator is a professor of English literature at a university in the United States . He is writing a book about his father , and he is also writing a book about his uncle . The narrator is in his office when he receives a phone call from his brother . The narrator's brother tells him that their father has died . The narrator is shocked by this , and he asks his brother how he found out about their father's death . His brother replies that he

In 2007, it was reprinted by Harper Perennial in the United States and by Penguin in the United Kingdom , with minor revisions by Steiner .

The book's title was inspired by the 1977 song "I Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner .

## Summary

The book is a collection of 120 short stories by Steiner, with the first story appearing on page 1 and the last story appearing on page 120 .

## Reception

In 1981, the book won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best Book (Overall Winner) , and was nominated for the 1981 James Tait Black Memorial Prize .

In 2007, The New York Times Book Review said: "The stories are as unified by their tight focus on the individual lives of their characters as by their shared concern for the dislocation and solitude that are the lot of the urban dweller. Some are heartbreaking, some are funny, some are both. All are written with a sure touch and an eye for telling detail."

In 2016, The Guardian said: "The stories are spare and economical, yet they are also suffused with Steiner's sensuous observation of the world around him. The stories are all about the effects of city life on the individual, and the emotional truths they reveal are often painful. Steiner's is a vision of a world that is alienating and lonely, but also beautiful and rich in detail. His characters are usually solitary, and they live in a world of solitude, alienation and estrangement."

 prudence , and sometimes the reviewer was not even sure that Steiner had a good understanding of Hitler . A 1941 review of Steiner 's The Triumph of the West , for example , found the book " a surprisingly good example of how a man can be driven to the most unreasonable conclusions by the lack of a modicum of common sense " . Steiner 's " overweening arrogance " , the reviewer concluded , " is just as remarkable as his almost complete lack of knowledge of the subject he is writing about " . 73
The reviewers had no doubt that Steiner 's books were the product of an unusual mind , but they were also sure that his ideas were mad. The most common objection to Steiner 's work was that it was " unintelligible " , " incomprehensible " , " unintelligible jargon " , " unintelligible gibberish " , and " baffling " . A reviewer of Steiner 's The New Science of the Mind , for example , complained that the book was " so full of unintelligible technical jargon " that it would be " inaccessible to the general reader " . The reviewer of The Triumph of the West , which contained much " unintelligible jargon " , thought that " the book must be classed as a contribution to the literature of the unintelligible " . 74 The same reviewer , however , concluded that Steiner 's books were not " mad " , and that Steiner himself was not mad . Steiner 's ideas , the reviewer wrote , were " so confused and muddled " that they " reveal a mind almost completely out of touch with reality " , but Steiner himself was not out of touch with reality. The reviewer was convinced that Steiner had " a mind capable of rational thought " , but that his " unintelligible gibberish " had led him to " a kind of mental chaos " . 75
The reviewer of The Triumph of the West thought that Steiner 's ideas were " hardly madness " but that they " reveal a mind too full of unrelated ideas " . Steiner 's ideas were " incomprehensible " , the reviewer wrote , but that did not mean they were "

Forster commended Steiner 's ability to describe the character and mood of the people around Hitler , but he felt that the book was too long and too heavy on description . He also questioned the book 's value in explaining Hitler 's rise to power . Forster said that Steiner had a " superior grasp of the German language " , but that this " does not necessarily add to the understanding of Hitler " . The New Yorker review was positive , saying that Steiner had " managed to write an intelligent book about Hitler , without compromising his sense of irony or his own personality " . The New Yorker praised the book 's " remarkable balance " , and said that Steiner had succeeded in " avoiding the temptation to overdramatize or to understate " . The Washington Post review , by George L . Mosse , was negative . Mosse was critical of Steiner 's " uncritical acceptance of Hitler 's verbal style " and felt that the book failed to show how Hitler's rhetoric influenced the German people . Mosse also criticized Steiner 's " one-dimensional characterization of Hitler " . He concluded that the book " does not rise to the level of history " . The New York Review of Books review , by Joseph R . McElrath , Jr. , was positive . McElrath called the book " an extraordinary achievement " and said that Steiner " has brought us closer to Hitler than any other biographer " . He said that Steiner had succeeded in " restoring Hitler to the level of a human being " . McElrath concluded that the book was " a compelling and memorable portrait of the man who changed the course of history " . The Los Angeles Times review , by J . M . Cameron , was negative . Cameron said that the book was " a tedious slog " and that the " overwhelming feeling is one of disappointment " . He concluded that the book was " a failure " . The Guardian review , by David J .

### Max Weber

The American historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. wrote that the "central idea" of Hitler 's book was "the idea of the 'destiny ' of the German people". According to the historian Richard Steigmann-Gall, the book "stressed the necessity for the Germans to follow their destiny to the exclusion of all others". The German sociologist Max Weber wrote in 1919 that the book contained "one-sided, nationalist, and in many respects objectionable" ideas, but that it "had a certain charm", and that the "danger of the book lay in its tendency to make the reader forget that it was written by a half-insane and unscrupulous agitator".

### Thomas Mann

The German writer Thomas Mann wrote in 1934 that the book "contained many excellent sentences and whole pages of the first rank", but that "Hitler's prose is always and only the expression of a certain type of mind". The German writer Ernst Bloch wrote in 1936 that the book was "a literary masterpiece, a hymn to the German people", and that "Hitler is a great artist". The German writer Thomas Mann wrote in 1939 that the book was "one of the most wonderful books of our time", but that "Hitler was an artist, but a terrible one".

### Erich Maria Remarque

The German writer Erich Maria Remarque wrote in 1939 that the book was "a work of art", but that "Hitler was a genius, but a terrible one". The German writer Erich Maria Remarque wrote in 1939 that the book was "a work of art", but that "Hitler was a genius, but a terrible one".

> ) <unk> ) is an extinct class of amphibians that lived during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. They are sometimes referred to as "pre-amphibians", as they were a transitional form between the amphibians and the more primitive amphibian-like amniotes. 

 Temnospondyls were the most abundant tetrapods of the Devonian and Carboniferous. In the Late Devonian, the diversity of temnospondyls reached its peak, and by the Late Carboniferous, temnospondyls were a minor component of the fauna. The most common temnospondyls were small, semi-aquatic animals with smooth skin and eyes adapted for swimming, but the group also included terrestrial species and gigantic forms that could reach lengths of over three meters. 

 Temnospondyls were a diverse group, and the relationships of the various taxa are still unclear. They are divided into three major groups, the dissorophoids, the capitosauroids, and the rhaetosauroids. The dissorophoids were the earliest and most primitive temnospondyls, and are the sister group to the capitosauroids. The rhaetosauroids are the most derived group, and are thought to be the sister group to the capitosauroids. 

 Temnospondyls were the first amniotes to give birth to live young, rather than laying eggs. They also had an amniotic egg sac, which was filled with amniotic fluid. This fluid provided buoyancy, which allowed the young to stay afloat in the water. The amniotic egg sac also provided a protective environment for the young, and allowed them to develop outside of the water. 

 Temnospondyls were an important component of the Devonian and Carboniferous fauna, and played a role in the evolution of the amniotes. They were the first amniotes to give birth to live young, and were a major component of the Devonian and Carboniferous fauna.

## Classification

Temnospondyli was first named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1869 as a suborder of "Amphibia" . It was first described as a separate order by Charles W. Andrews in 1922 .

Temnospondyli is currently classified as an order by most experts . It has been classified as a suborder by some .

## Paleobiology

Temnospondyli had a wide range of body shapes . Many were large , but some were small . The largest known temnospondyls were from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic , and grew up to 5.5 meters (18 ft) long . They were aquatic , but some may have been semiaquatic or terrestrial .

Temnospondyli are thought to have had a skull-less oral cavity . Their feeding mechanisms are uncertain , although many species may have been herbivores . They may have had teeth , and they probably had a tongue .

Temnospondyli are thought to have had a complex social structure , including social groups that contained both males and females .

 The fossil record of <unk> is poor . Only one complete <unk> skeleton is known . This was found in 1995 in the Mazon Creek biota of Illinois . It is 
preserved in the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford , Illinois . The fossil is one of the most complete of the Mazon Creek fauna . It is 
composed of a skull , spine , shoulder girdle and pelvis . The skull has been reconstructed . It is 41 centimetres (16 in) in length and is similar to that of a modern manatee . The skull is 
fairly small for an aquatic mammal , and has many similarities to the skull of an
alligator . 

 The only other fossils of <unk> are isolated bones , including jaw fragments and
vertebrae . These fossils are from the Mazon Creek biota . They are also from 
the Middle Pennsylvanian (Serpukhovian) of Russia , and the Middle Carboniferous (Gzhelian) of Poland .

> anciful resemblance to the Mastodon " . Owen's Labyrinthodon was a junior synonym of Mastodonsaurus . 

The type species is Mastodonsaurus giganteus .

## Description

Size of the genus was variable, with Mastodonsaurus giganteus being the largest at up to 12.5 m (41 ft) in length.

## Taxonomy

Mastodonsaurus was classified as a member of the group Sauropterygia, which included the two subgroups Pistosauria and Placodontia. It was the type genus of the Placodontia, a group of early marine tetrapods that were well-adapted to a marine environment. The placodonts were some of the first tetrapods to live in the sea, and are thought to have evolved from amphibious pistosaurs. Mastodonsaurus was an herbivorous animal, with a large, flat mouth, and small teeth, making it a typical placodont. 

The Mastodonsaurus was a large marine tetrapod that lived in the Early Triassic period. It had a wide, flat head and a large, flat mouth, and its teeth were small and flattened. The Mastodonsaurus was an herbivore, and its diet consisted of algae and other plants.

### 20th century

During the 20th century , the name <unk> was used for both the <unk> and the <unk> . This was because <unk> and <unk> were similar in many ways , but <unk> had a more basal position in the <unk> . The <unk> was also more similar to <unk> , and thus <unk> was also considered a <unk> . The <unk> name was also used for the <unk> , a group of extinct tetrapods that lived during the Devonian .

 In the 1930s , German palaeontologist Friedrich von Huene grouped the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> together into a new group called <unk> . This group was based on similarities in their skulls and jaws . The <unk> was considered to be a <unk> , but it was also considered to be a <unk> . In the 1960s , the <unk> was classified as a <unk> . 

 The <unk> was first classified as a <unk> in 1980 by American paleontologist Robert Reisz . Reisz placed the <unk> in a superorder called <unk> , a name coined by him in 1979 . <unk> is derived from <unk> , the name for <unk> . <unk> means " roof headed " in Greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads of <unk> and other early tetrapods . <unk> also refers to the roof-shaped skulls of <unk> and <unk> . Reisz placed <unk> in the <unk> , a group of <unk> that includes the <unk> and the <unk> .

### Classification

<unk> are a paraphyletic group. The taxonomic status of <unk> has been a subject of debate, as it was unclear whether they were a monophyletic group, and if so, whether they were more closely related to <unk> or <unk> . In 2005, <unk> was classified as a <unk> , but later studies showed it to be a <unk> .

## History

Temnospondyls are often referred to as "prehistoric amphibians" but were actually more closely related to modern amphibians than to reptiles. They were often contemporaries of the early amniotes (the group that includes modern reptiles, birds, and mammals). They are thought to have been the dominant vertebrate fauna in the Mesozoic Era.

The group is based on the genus Temnospondyli by the German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1914. The name means "early bone" and is derived from the Greek temno-, meaning "early", and sondylos, meaning "vertebra". It is a reference to the primitive vertebrae of these amphibians.

## Classification

A 2015 phylogenetic analysis found that temnospondyls are the sister group to amniotes, but that they are not a clade and are not the closest relatives of amniotes. Instead, they are the closest relatives of the group Lepospondyli, which includes the families Lysorophidae and Aistopoda.

Temnospondyls are divided into two subgroups, the Stereospondylomorpha (also known as the "Cochleosauromorpha") and the Atherosauromorpha (also known as the "Pachyosteosauromorpha").

### Stereospondylomorpha

The Stereospondylomorpha are a group of temnospondyls that were the most advanced temnospondyls, with many species having a large, well-developed temporal fossa. This fossa is thought to have been used for hearing and could also have been used to amplify sound.

#### Subgroups

The Stereospondylomorpha are divided into two subgroups: the Cochleosauromorpha and the Pachyosteosauromorpha.

The Cochleosauromorpha are a group of temnospondyls that have a large temporal fossa. This group includes the family Cochleosauridae.

 Mesozoic and Cenozoic amphibians were relatively unspecialized and resembled their modern counterparts . Many species were adapted to aquatic life , and most of the few fossil species known are known from marine sediments . The modern amphibians have become widely distributed , with species in every major habitat , including marine , desert , and polar regions . Many amphibians are adapted to life on land , but still require access to water to breed .

<p><b>Context:</b> The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event around 199 million years ago led to the extinction of most Mesozoic amphibians, the amphibians survived, as well as a few reptiles and mammals. While the reptiles soon became extinct, amphibians persisted and grew to large sizes during the Jurassic. Among amphibians, the temnospondyls flourished in China and the labyrinthodonts became common in Gondwana. The most recent known temnospondyl was the <unk> (Lydekker, 1890), which became extinct around 65 million years ago. </p>

 realms , and a great diversity of ecomorphs ( functional forms ) have evolved . These adaptations are generally thought to be related to feeding strategies , and it is likely that many of the changes are adaptive . However , some of the diversity of ecomorphs may be related to dietary and environmental constraints , and many are likely to be a result of secondary adaptations . In this review , I will concentrate on the changes that have occurred in the skull , and I will discuss the functional implications of these changes .

This would seem to make sense , as the snout of an ecomorph is often much shorter than that of other lizards . The snout of some ecomorphs is almost entirely absent , and in some species the snout is reduced to a simple flap of skin . The snout of these species is also much flatter , with a broader cross-section than the snouts of other lizards . These adaptations are believed to be related to the feeding habits of the lizards . Some ecomorphs are thought to be insectivorous , and the shape of the snout may be related to the shape of insects . The broad flat snout of insectivorous lizards may make it easier for them to detect prey by sensing vibrations . The flattened snout may also be an adaptation for burrowing , as it would make it easier for the lizard to move through narrow spaces . The snout of insectivorous lizards is often longer than that of other lizards , which may be an adaptation for catching and eating large prey .

> to the inner ear . The stapes is homologous to the mammalian stirrup bone and the human anvil bone . The stirrup bone is a rod of bone in the middle ear that attaches to the tympanic membrane . The anvil is a short bone in the middle ear that attaches to the stirrup bone . The stapes is the only bone of the mammalian middle ear that is not homologous to any other bone in the mammalian body . It is a unique bone that arose independently in mammals . 

 In the 1990s , studies of the fossilized middle ears of living amphibians and reptiles revealed that the stapes is not found in the middle ear of these animals . The stapes is not found in any tetrapod ancestor , and is not found in the fossilized middle ears of early tetrapods . The stapes was thought to have evolved very early in tetrapod evolution , but is not found in any known fossilized tetrapods . The fossil record of the stapes is thus complete and fossilized tetrapods do not have the stapes . The stapes is thus a tetrapod unique bone that arose very early in tetrapod evolution and is not found in any known fossilized tetrapods . 

 Thus , the tympanum and stapes are both unique bones that arose very early in tetrapod evolution and are not found in any known fossilized tetrapods . 

 Thus , <unk> possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles . However , the tympanum and stapes are both unique bones that arose very early in tetrapod evolution and are not found in any known fossilized tetrapods .

After the other birds have left to migrate , the duckling is left alone on the lake . When the duckling's mother comes back, she does not recognize her son and leaves him behind again . The duckling grows up and becomes a beautiful swan , which is admired by the other birds . The moral of the story is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder .

After the boy's teacher encourages him to wear his glasses , he is able to see clearly , which allows him to see that his classmates are not as good at sports as he is . The book ends with the classmates asking the boy to play with them , and the boy saying, "Okay, I'll play, but I'm going to wear my glasses."

 Many tetrapods have two temporal bones . This is a primitive feature that is also found in many reptiles . The temporal bones are separated by a space called the temporal fossa . This fossa is home to the middle meningeal artery , a branch of the internal carotid artery . The temporal fossa is also home to the perforating arteries of the trigeminal nerve . These perforating arteries supply the frontal region of the brain with blood . 

 The lateral temporal bone has a large opening called the foramen ovale . This foramen is the entrance to the foramen lacerum . The foramen lacerum is a large opening in the skull that contains the auditory canal . The auditory canal is lined with the tympanic membrane .

### Intensity

Tropical cyclone intensity is determined by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS) . The intensity of a tropical cyclone is determined by the maximum 1 -minute sustained surface wind speed . The SSHWS ranks tropical cyclones from Category 1 ( winds of 74 mph , 119 km / h ) to Category 5 ( winds of 157 mph , 253 km / h ) . The maximum sustained wind speed is taken from the National Hurricane Center's best track .

### Track

Tropical cyclone tracks are determined by the National Hurricane Center . The track is determined by a combination of the best available observations from reconnaissance aircraft and satellite imagery . The storm's course is then adjusted to the best track . The best track is a combination of the official forecast track and all other available data . The official forecast track is issued by the National Hurricane Center .

### Other criteria

Several other criteria may be used to determine the intensity of a tropical cyclone. In the Atlantic Ocean , the Dvorak Technique is used to determine the intensity of a tropical cyclone . The Dvorak Technique assigns a number from 1 to 5 to the storm based on the radar reflectivity of the storm's convection . In the Northwestern Pacific Ocean , the JTWC uses the TCFAI ( Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ) technique to determine the intensity of tropical cyclones . The TCFAI technique assigns a number from 0 to 6 to the storm based on the storm's convective structure . The TCFAI is a very crude method of intensity analysis and is only used as an initial estimate .

### Storm names

Tropical cyclones are named by a variety of naming schemes around the world . The United States uses a 21-name list which is recycled every six years . The names are chosen by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) . The WMO's World Meteorological Congress selects the list of names for each basin .

> of Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan

The following is a detail of the Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan (TCOP) of the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC). The plan is based on the Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Forecasting Plan, which was first developed in 1986. 

The TCOP is the NHC's plan for issuing forecasts and warnings for tropical cyclones within the Atlantic basin, including the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Atlantic Ocean. The NHC is responsible for issuing tropical cyclone advisories and warnings for the entirety of the basin. The NHC is under the jurisdiction of the National Weather Service (NWS), which is a branch of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NWS is under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Commerce (DOC).

### Forecasts

The NHC provides forecasts and warnings for tropical cyclones within the Atlantic basin. Forecasts include information about the forecast track, intensity, and the likelihood of the tropical cyclone making landfall. Forecasts are issued in two formats: graphical and textual.

The graphical forecast is issued in the form of a track forecast map. The map includes a forecast track, a cone of uncertainty, and the likelihood of the tropical cyclone making landfall. The track forecast map is issued every 6 hours and is revised every 12 hours. The cone of uncertainty is a graphical representation of the uncertainty in the forecast track. The likelihood of the tropical cyclone making landfall is represented by a probability contour map.

The textual forecast is issued in the form of a forecast discussion. The forecast discussion includes information about the forecast track, intensity, and the likelihood of the tropical cyclone making landfall. The forecast discussion is issued every 6 hours and is revised every 12 hours.

### Warnings

The NHC issues tropical cyclone warnings for tropical cyclones within the Atlantic basin. Warnings are issued in two formats: graphical and textual.

The graphical warning is issued in the form of a warning cone. The warning cone is a graphical representation of the uncertainty in the forecast track. The warning

 The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS) is a 1 to 5 rating scale based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed, where Category 3 is a severe hurricane, and Category 5 is an extremely severe hurricane. The SSHWS was developed in 1971 by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson. It is used by many countries that experience tropical cyclones.


 A cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure. The word cyclone is a loanword from the Greek κύκλων (kyklon), meaning "circular" or "cycle".


 The first tropical cyclone of the season, Tropical Depression 1, formed on January 12, 1995, in the South Pacific. The first named storm, Tropical Storm Amelia, developed on March 21, 1995, in the South Pacific.


 The 1995 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly below-average season in terms of tropical cyclone formation, with 17 tropical storms and 10 typhoons developing during the season. The season's first tropical cyclone, Tropical Depression 1, developed on January 12. The season's last tropical cyclone, Typhoon Mireille, dissipated on December 29.


 The 1995 Atlantic hurricane season was an average season that produced ten tropical storms, six hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. The season officially began on June 1, 1995, and officially ended on November 30, 1995. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin.

> zero and four , with four representing the strongest storm . A tropical cyclone with a CI value of zero is classified as a " minimal tropical cyclone " ( MTC ) , a storm with a CI value of one is classified as a " tropical depression " ( TD ) , a storm with a CI value of two is classified as a " tropical storm " ( TS ) , a storm with a CI value of three is classified as a " severe tropical storm " ( STS ) , and a storm with a CI value of four is classified as a " very severe tropical storm " ( VSTS ) .
 Of the six tropical cyclone intensity classifications defined by the JTWC , four of them are based on infrared satellite imagery . The two remaining classifications , Category 5 and Category 5 Super Typhoon , are based on the intensity of a storm as measured by a wind speed of 155 knots ( 178 mph ) or greater . The two classifications are interchangeable in that the JTWC can classify a storm as a Category 5 or as a Category 5 Super Typhoon based on the available data .
 The JTWC is the only international organization that uses the " T @-@ number " and " CI " intensity classifications . The JTWC's intensity classifications are used by the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) and the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) , and are used by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , the United States Navy's Fleet Weather Center , the United States Air Force Weather Agency , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) .
The JTWC's tropical cyclone intensity scale is one of three tropical cyclone intensity scales that are used in the Pacific Ocean . The other two scales are the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ( SSHWS ) and the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale ( ATCIS ) . The SSHWS and the ATCIS are both used by the NHC , the CPHC , the JMA and PAGASA .

Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds greater than 80 miles per hour ( 130 km / h ) are considered major hurricanes. [ 11 ] A tropical cyclone is considered to be a hurricane when it is either a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour ( 119 km / h ) or a tropical storm with a minimum barometric pressure of 982 millibars or lower.

 NESDIS Storm Surge Watch and Warning System
The NESDIS Storm Surge Watch and Warning System ( SSWWS ) is a system which can be used to issue warnings for coastal regions in the event of a tropical cyclone . This system uses a combination of in situ observations and numerical model outputs to determine the likelihood that a tropical cyclone will make landfall and if it will cause a storm surge .
The SSWWS is a system which is run by the NESDIS . It is used by the NWS to determine if a tropical cyclone will cause a storm surge in the United States . The system consists of a computer model called the "Surge Model" and a number of subsystems which use in situ observations to determine the position and intensity of the tropical cyclone . The model is a three dimensional barotropic model which is run using the National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center's ( NHC ) best track data .
The Surge Model is run at 3 hour intervals for a 12 hour period . The model uses the NHC's best track data to determine the position of the tropical cyclone . The model then uses a combination of the NHC's best track data and in situ observations to determine the intensity of the tropical cyclone . The model then calculates the height of the surge . The model then calculates the surge height for a 12 hour period .

 A tropical depression is a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 38 miles per hour ( 62 km / h ) or less . The term tropical depression is used for both tropical storms that have weakened below tropical storm intensity , as well as for newly formed tropical storms . The term tropical depression is also used by the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard for non-tropical storms that have winds of 34 miles per hour ( 54 km / h )

 transportation of water vapor into the atmosphere . This is the process by which the ocean produces the majority of the world's precipitation . The greatest amount of evaporation occurs over tropical oceans with warm temperatures , high humidity , and large areas of open water . The amount of evaporation varies with the type of ocean surface , with open ocean areas having higher evaporation rates than coastal areas . Tropical cyclones are known to increase evaporation rates over the oceans they traverse , which can increase the water vapor content of the atmosphere . The primary mechanism for this increase in water vapor content is the transport of warm, moist air from the ocean into the atmosphere . Tropical cyclones can also lead to increased evaporation rates over land , as the storms can increase the humidity of the atmosphere over land by transporting moist air from the ocean . This increase in humidity can cause localized rainfall events over land , as well as lead to the formation of severe thunderstorms . Tropical cyclones can also have a significant impact on the climate of an area by affecting the local temperature and precipitation patterns . These storms can lead to cooler temperatures and increased precipitation over the areas they pass through , as well as lead to increased evaporation rates over the oceans they traverse . The impact of tropical cyclones on the climate of an area can vary depending on the storm's strength , its location , and the time of year it occurs . For example , a tropical cyclone that occurs during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere can lead to cooler temperatures and increased precipitation over the affected area . On the other hand , a tropical cyclone that occurs during the winter months in the Southern Hemisphere can lead to warmer temperatures and decreased precipitation over the affected area . In general , tropical cyclones can have a significant impact on the climate of an area by affecting the local temperature and precipitation patterns . The impact of tropical cyclones on the climate of an area can vary depending on the storm's strength , its location , and the time of year it occurs .

 Location of the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles .
 Dodger Stadium is a ballpark located in Los Angeles , California , United States . The stadium serves as the home of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball . The stadium has been in use since 1962 and has undergone several renovations , including a $100 million renovation in 1993 that added luxury suites and club seats . Dodger Stadium is a favorite of baseball fans and players , who have voted Dodger Stadium the best place to watch a game and the best place to play a game in Major League Baseball .
 Dodger Stadium was built to replace the team's former home, Ebbets Field , which was demolished after the 1957 season. The park was constructed in less than three years, and the Dodgers played their first game at Dodger Stadium on April 10, 1962, defeating the then-San Francisco Giants 6–5 . The Dodgers won their first game at Dodger Stadium by scoring four runs in the bottom of the ninth inning. The game was the first of three Dodger victories in the series.
The Dodgers won the first World Series game played at Dodger Stadium, defeating the Chicago White Sox 5–1 in Game 1 of the 1963 World Series . The Dodgers would go on to win the series in six games.
During the 1960s, Dodger Stadium was a favorite of many visiting teams. This was due to the ballpark's large size, as the park was the largest in the National League at the time. The Dodgers, however, struggled to fill the ballpark. The Dodgers were a popular team in the city, and the team was well supported by the local media . However, the team was unable to attract a large local fanbase, and it was not until the 1970s that the team began to attract a large following.

A number of commercial galleries have specialised in Indigenous Australian art since the 1980s , and have achieved significant sales . However , the commercial galleries and the art centres that represent Indigenous artists have been criticised for selling artwork that is not created by Indigenous Australians , for not paying artists a fair price , and for being overly influenced by tourism and the market . Artists have also been criticised for using their art to gain material benefits . The contemporary art market in Australia is influenced by trends and changes in the art market worldwide . The market is also influenced by the popularity of Indigenous art . A " boom " in Indigenous art sales occurred in the late 1990s . A significant proportion of the sales of Indigenous art are made through the art centres . These sales are significant to the Indigenous artists and their communities .

His work was dismissed by some critics as "aesthetically worthless" , and was also seen as a "disgrace to the nation" by the influential art critic Herbert Read . But he had also found support from influential figures such as John Betjeman and Henry Moore , and he was well connected in London's artistic community. He had been introduced to the art dealer Erica Brausen by his friend and fellow artist John Edwards , and Brausen had become his patron and close friend. In the 1950s , she became the first owner of several of his paintings , including Study for a Self Portrait — Triptych , Study for a Self Portrait , and Study for a Self Portrait — In Memory of George Dyer .

As well as being a key work in Bacon's early oeuvre , Head VI is considered to be one of the most important paintings of the 20th century . It has been described as "a masterpiece" by the art historian Martin Harrison , and as "the most important painting of the century" by the critic Robert Hughes . It was included in the 1976 exhibition The Human Clay: Francis Bacon at the Tate Gallery in London , and was the subject of a 1998–1999 retrospective of Bacon's work at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City . It has been described as a "triumph of modern art" by the art historian James Hall .

## Background

Bacon had first started to paint self-portraits in 1944, and had created a number of drawings and sketches of himself during the 1940s and early 1950s . In 1947 he completed his first full-length oil portrait of himself, Self Portrait , and later that year he completed another, Study for a Self Portrait . He continued to paint self-portraits throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , and by 1962 he had completed over 30 of them .

In 1962 Bacon completed a number of paintings of heads , including Study for a Self Portrait — Triptych ,

## Background

After returning from the United States in 1956 , Bacon settled in London . In 1957 , he rented a studio in Reece Mews in South Kensington and began work on a series of paintings based on the skull motif . He was not interested in traditional still-life subjects , but chose a figurative subject because he felt that it was the "only thing that's really worth painting , because you're trying to get to some kind of truth ." He found the skull to be a "hypnotic image" , and was fascinated by its "grinning jaw" and "the gaping mouth and the eye sockets ." The skull became the subject of a number of paintings , which were shown at the Marlborough Fine Art gallery in May 1958 . The exhibition was a success , and the painter Francis Bacon was born . Bacon's next series of paintings were based on the human head , which he had first painted in 1949 . He considered the human head to be a "complex" subject , and one that had a "lot of different things going on in it ."

## Description

The series is the first major body of work to be painted by Bacon after his return to England. The five works are all oil on canvas . They are among the earliest of Bacon's paintings to be produced in the studio in Reece Mews. The artist's first biographer, David Sylvester, described the series as "the most extraordinary in Bacon's career, and perhaps in the career of any other painter."

The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they anticipate his later work. The artist's first biographer, David Sylvester, commented that "the five paintings are the most extraordinary in Bacon's career, and perhaps in the career of any other painter."

 Russell felt that Bacon's work "is not in the least figurative . It is the transposition of a face into a pattern of colours and textures . " The artist's distorted and fragmented portraits , he said , were "far more abstract than the work of Mondrian . " He said of Bacon's paintings : "They are a distillation of everything that we know , a new vision of reality . "

 Russell wrote that Bacon was "the most original and exciting artist working in England today . "

 Russell felt that Bacon's painting was "the art of the future . "

 Russell was a friend of Bacon's and he was the first to publish a major essay on the artist's work . In a 1949 essay for Horizon magazine , Russell argued that Bacon was "the greatest living painter " and that "the whole of his work is a search for the meaning of the human figure . " Russell wrote : "If we look at the human face in terms of a pattern of colour and texture , then we will see that it is infinitely more complex than we ever suspected . "

 Russell felt that Bacon's portraits were "an attempt to translate the human face into a pattern of colour and texture . "

 Russell believed that the most important work in Bacon's oeuvre was the Head series .

> s a recurring motif in Bacon 's paintings . A smoky haze is visible in the background , and the figures of the pope and the man to his left are faintly visible in the background . The man to the left is recognisable as Bacon 's friend and lover , Peter Lacy . He appears in many of Bacon 's paintings , usually as a human figure in a chair or on a bed , and is usually depicted as an almost ethereal presence in a room with a window . The pope 's face is illuminated by a single spotlight . Bacon 's depiction of the pope was influenced by his admiration for Velázquez 's Portrait of Pope Innocent X , which he owned , and which he later repainted in 1962 . In this painting , the pope 's face is illuminated by a single spotlight , and is framed by a " dimensional " glass cage . The pope 's face is rendered in shades of grey , with a bluish tinge . The painting is one of Bacon 's first figurative works . Bacon created a series of paintings of Pope Innocent X and a series of paintings of popes in general . The paintings were exhibited in London in 1963 . The paintings were not well received , and Bacon was criticised for his depiction of the pope . The pope was considered to be a sacred figure , and Bacon 's paintings were seen as sacrilegious . The paintings were described as " disrespectful " and " disgusting " . Bacon's response to the criticism was to say that the paintings were not meant to be seen as religious . Bacon said that the paintings were about " the terror of the pope " and that they were " about the death of the pope " . He also said that the paintings were " not about religion , but about the death of God " . The paintings were seen as a challenge to the Catholic Church , and were seen as a " provocation " to the Church . The paintings were seen as a " blasphemous attack on the Church " . The paintings were seen as an " attack on the Catholic Church " . The paintings were seen as " a deliberate provocation to the Catholic Church "

 In 1989, the photographer David Dawson visited Bacon in his studio and observed that the artist's images of the mouth were " very disturbing , the mouth is a very erotic symbol , the mouth is a very powerful sexual symbol , and it's a symbol that has been used for centuries in pornography , but I think that's what I like about it , I think it's got a very strong erotic feeling , but it's got a very disturbing feeling ."
 In 1990, Bacon told the writer David Sylvester that he liked to paint the mouth as " a kind of orifice , which is like a sort of well , you know , the well of the body ." Sylvester noted that in the late 1970s and early 1980s Bacon had painted a series of images of a mouth in which the mouth was " completely open , and the whole mouth is just a gaping hole ."
In 2008, the journalist Matthew Sweet interviewed the photographer Peter Beard , who had taken a number of photographs of Bacon in his studio. Beard told Sweet that Bacon's paintings of the mouth " were very sexualized and I think that was an important part of the appeal to Francis , because he was so homosexual ."
In 2014, the filmmaker and writer Derek Jarman wrote about the mouth in Bacon's paintings , stating that the mouth was " the gateway to the soul , the place of feeling , of emotion , of sensation , of desire , of fear , of pain , of ecstasy , of memory , of all the things that make us human ."
 In 2015, the curator Robert Rauschenberg wrote that " the mouth is the source of human experience , of all the physical senses and emotions ."
In 2017, the art historian and curator Sir Norman Rosenthal wrote that " the mouth is the source of human experience ."
In 2018, the curator and writer Martin Gayford wrote that Bacon's paintings of the mouth " are portraits of a kind , but they are also more than that , they are portraits of the human soul ,

 The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the artist is attempting to escape from , or the cage might be a transparent shell within which the artist is enclosed and protected . Bacon never explained what the cages were intended to symbolise . The cages , like the heads , were painted over a number of sessions , and it is not always easy to distinguish between the earlier and later paintings . Bacon ' s use of glass in the paintings was unusual at the time , and the technique of using glass as a support has been called " an early experiment in the medium of acrylic glass .

In a 1951 letter to his friend, the art critic Herbert Read , Bacon wrote: "I was thinking of a face, and then of the glass box, and then of a face behind glass, and then of the face of a dead man in a glass box ." The scream is also often seen as a reference to the horrors of the Spanish Civil War , in which Bacon's father fought on the side of the Republicans . The scream is seen as a reference to the horrific death of the young Spanish republican poet and artist , Luis Buñuel , who was beheaded in the same war.

> f Pope Paul IV .

 The large triptych depicting a reclining nude (1962) was Bacon 's first large canvas since 1953 . It is based on a photograph of his lover George Dyer .

 The distortions in the 1966 Triptych are in part influenced by the surrealist painter Giorgio de Chirico .

 The 1969 Head VI is another example of Bacon 's use of the portrait motif . It was the first painting he created after the death of Dyer in 1971 .

### Self-portraits

The artist's self-portrait, 1965

Bacon was the subject of several self-portraits . He was also the subject of several photographs by photographers such as John Deakin and David Bailey .

The first self-portrait Bacon made was in 1949 . It is a pen and ink drawing and it shows Bacon in a chair with his hands on his head .

The first painting Bacon made of himself was in 1954 . It is a large triptych that shows the artist in profile .

The 1965 self-portrait was painted at the height of Bacon 's success . It shows him with a mop of curly hair . He is wearing a dark suit with a tie .

The 1971 self-portrait was painted in the aftermath of the death of his lover George Dyer . It shows him with a shaved head and a dark suit .

The 1974 self-portrait is a painting of Bacon with a mop of curly hair . It was painted shortly before his death .

> ian , including the 1550s portrait of Pope Paul IV . In the late 1950s , he began to paint with the veil in mind , and in the early 1960s , he began to use it as a motif in his paintings . In the 1960s , he developed a close association with the American pop artist Andy Warhol . Warhol was interested in Bacon's work , and asked him to paint his portrait . Bacon did so , but the two men never met . Warhol said of Bacon : " He 's a very good painter and he knows exactly what he wants . " Bacon was a dedicated collector of art , and his collection of modern paintings included works by Picasso , Matisse , and Francis Bacon . He also collected postwar art , including works by Roy Lichtenstein , David Hockney , and Gerhard Richter . He was a friend and patron of Lucian Freud , and commissioned several portraits of him . In the 1960s , Bacon began to collect pre-Columbian art , and he assembled a large collection of objects from the Americas , including pottery and textiles . He also collected African art , and he owned a number of masks and figures from the Congo . Bacon was a lifelong smoker , and he suffered from chronic asthma . He also suffered from high blood pressure and a heart condition . He was admitted to the hospital several times in the 1960s , and in 1971 , he had a heart attack and a stroke . After the stroke , he was unable to paint , and he never fully recovered . He died in Madrid on 28 April 1992 , at the age of 74 .
Bacon's work has been the subject of numerous retrospectives and major exhibitions . The Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris held a major retrospective of Bacon's work in 2009 . The exhibition , which featured 110 works , was the first major retrospective of Bacon's work in France since 1986 . The exhibition was shown in Paris from 30 September 2009 to 26 January 2010 , and it was shown in London from 26 February to 11 July 2

 The work is painted in Bacon 's characteristic " triptych " format , that is , three panels arranged in a triangular shape . In the centre panel , a man's head is painted in a ghostly , almost blurred , and very dark manner . He is seen from the side , with his mouth open and his eyes closed . His mouth is painted with a white pigment that is almost luminescent , and the lips are dark red . His head is partly obscured by a thin white veil or curtain , which is painted with a thick white pigment and appears to have been smeared or brushed across the canvas in a rough manner . This curtain is further obscured by a blue-green veil , which is also painted in a rough and almost impasto manner . This veil is similar in appearance to the curtains that are painted in the background of Bacon 's 1949 Study from the Human Body . The man's head is painted in a similar manner to the 1949 study . 

 The man's head is surrounded by an abstract background of green and blue . This background is painted in a thin impasto and is almost completely obscured by the white veil . The background is painted in a manner that is reminiscent of the abstract backgrounds that Bacon painted in his 1950s paintings . It is unclear whether the man is meant to be seen as a human figure or as a part of the abstract background . 

 The man's head is painted in a similar manner to the 1953 Portrait of George Dyer . 

 The man's head is reminiscent of the 1955 Study for a Self-Portrait . 

 Head VI is a rare example of a work by Bacon in which the artist painted himself . The man in the painting is believed to be Bacon , and the painting is believed to be a self-portrait . The man's head is painted in a manner that is similar to the 1954 Portrait of Lucian Freud .

> b er of ways . The unifying theme of the two paintings is the luminous lighting of the figure , but Bacon 's treatment is more diffuse . The background is a black void , with the figure isolated in a softly glowing pool of light . In contrast , Velázquez 's figure is placed in a darkened room lit by a single spotlight . Bacon 's work is also more abstract in its use of line and colour . Velázquez 's portrait is remarkably naturalistic , but Bacon distorts the figure in the manner of his self-portraits . The colours are also more abstract , with the figure rendered in a variety of cool and warm tones . The result is a more expressive image than Velázquez 's , with an intensity of feeling that recalls Bacon 's famous triptych of 1954-5 , Study after Velázquez 's Portrait of Pope Innocent X . Bacon was also inspired by the work of Titian , and his interpretation of the Titian portrait of Pope Paul III is more abstract than Velázquez 's . The painting was used as the front cover of the catalogue for the 1999 exhibition " Francis Bacon and the Tradition of Painting " .
Crucifixion , 1962 . The image is of a crucifixion scene in a desert landscape . The figure of Christ is reclining on a metal cross , with a dull red background and a yellow sky . The figure is rendered in a manner reminiscent of an Etruscan vase , with a large head , a long torso and small arms and legs . The work is one of a series of paintings based on the crucifixion . The paintings are markedly different from Bacon 's previous work , and are seen by some critics as a break from the artist's earlier work . The paintings are also a reaction against the religious paintings of the past , with their emphasis on the suffering of Christ . The Crucifixion paintings are seen as a return to the humanist tradition of Renaissance art , with an emphasis on the humanity of Christ . The paintings are also seen as a comment on the human condition , with the figure of Christ as a symbol of human suffering .

The positioning of the figures is a departure from Velázquez 's painting , in which the king sits with his hand on his sword , and the Pope leans over him . In Bacon 's painting , the Pope is seated and the king is standing , both looking away from the viewer . The Pope 's figure has been elongated and twisted , and he is looking down at the King . The King 's figure has been exaggerated to a monstrous size , and he appears to be looking up at the Pope . Bacon 's portrait is a distillation of the original , and by making a major change to the figures ' relationship , he was able to alter the meaning of the painting . The Pope 's hand is gently touching the King 's shoulder , and their relationship is one of mutual respect and trust . The King 's gaze is pensive , and the Pope 's gaze is warm and sympathetic .

### Heads I and VI

Heads I and VI are often regarded as the most famous and significant paintings in the series . Bacon had painted both at the end of 1949 and were first exhibited together in the exhibition. 

 "These two heads are the most disturbing and the most convincing. In one the face is pink , the eyes and mouth are blue. The flesh is mottled and shiny and the head is twisted as if it were being turned in a vice. In the other the face is green , the eyes and mouth are red. The flesh is grey and the head is twisted and stretched out of shape. Both heads are disturbing and horrible and yet somehow beautiful . 

 The pink head has an almost sickly appearance , while the green head is more vibrant . Peppiatt notes that the pink head was often compared to the work of Francis Bacon , the artist 's great uncle .

 Bacon 's Heads are frequently compared to those of the Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbarán , as both artists used similar techniques to achieve their distinctive effect .

### Heads II and VII

Heads II and VII are often regarded as the most violent paintings in the series . Both were painted in 1950 , and were first exhibited together in the exhibition .

 "Head II has a green face with blue eyes and a red mouth . The flesh is smeared and greasy . The eyes are staring and the mouth is open and there is a gaping hole in the forehead . The head is tilted at an angle . Head VII has a pink face with blue eyes and a red mouth . The flesh is smeared and greasy . The eyes are staring and the mouth is open and there is a gaping hole in the forehead . The head is tilted at an angle . "

establishing himself as a leading contemporary artist , and making a major contribution to the development of figurative painting in post-war Britain.
In 1951 Bacon began to develop his early interest in a more abstract approach to painting. He started to paint in a more gestural style , using thicker paint and allowing it to run down the canvas , and used more expressive brushwork . He also began to use more colour in his work , and was inspired by the work of the abstract expressionist painters Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning , and the American sculptor David Smith. He was also influenced by the work of the Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla.
In 1952 Bacon's first solo exhibition was held at the Hanover Gallery in London. The exhibition was not a success , and Bacon's work was dismissed by some critics as " a competent but unexceptional product of the British avant-garde " .
In 1953 Bacon moved to Paris , where he lived for six years. During this time Bacon was inspired by the art of the French painter Georges Braque , and the German painter Max Beckmann , and began to paint in a more abstract style.
In 1954 Bacon's work was included in the exhibition " Young Contemporaries " at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. The exhibition was a success , and Bacon's work was praised by the critic David Sylvester , who wrote that Bacon had " an uncanny ability to express the human condition in the most direct way " .
In 1955 Bacon's work was included in the exhibition " This Is Tomorrow " at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London. The exhibition was a success , and Bacon's work was praised by the critic Clement Greenberg , who wrote that Bacon was " the best painter now working in England " .

The Imagist manifesto was written by Pound and published in 1913 in Poetry , the magazine of the Chicago-based Poetry Society of America . It was signed by Pound , H.D. , Aldington , Fletcher , Macleod , and Ezra Pound's brother, James (Jimmy) Pound . In 1914, a second Imagist manifesto appeared in the second issue of The Egoist , the journal edited by Pound and H.D. . This manifesto was signed by Pound , H.D. , Aldington , Fletcher , Macleod , and Harriet Monroe . The Imagist manifesto was based on the ideas of French symbolist poets, including Paul Verlaine , Stéphane Mallarmé , and Arthur Rimbaud . The manifesto stated that Imagism was ' a movement in poetry , founded on the assumption that art is an organ of nature , that the material of poetry is the actual world , and that art exists that the poet may, by the action of the imagination, create a reality of his own .' The manifesto also stated that the Imagists sought to create a poetry 'direct treatment of the ' thing ' , as well as 'to present an image .' In 1915, the Imagists published a volume called Some Imagist Poets , which contained the works of Pound, H.D. , Richard Aldington , Fiona Macleod , John Gould Fletcher , James Joyce , and others . Imagist poets were ' of one mind ' , according to Pound . They agreed on the need to simplify language , to eliminate superfluous words and phrases , and to use precise words and images . Imagism rejected the Romantic concept of the poet as a ' seer ' or ' prophet ' , and rejected the traditional notion that poetry should be ' a balm for the soul ' .

The Imagist movement was strongly influenced by the work of Ezra Pound , who edited and published the first Imagist anthology , Des Imagistes , in 1914 . 

 Imagist poetry was influential in the development of modernist poetry , and its influence can be seen in the work of poets such as Wallace Stevens , T. S. Eliot , James Joyce , William Carlos Williams , and W. H. Auden .

## History

The movement began in London in 1912 when Pound published the poem "In a Station of the Metro" in Poetry . This poem begins, "The apparition of these faces in the crowd / Petals on a wet black bough." In 1913, H.D. published her poem "Helen in Egypt" in Poetry . This poem begins, "The wind is rising / And the air is full of leaves, / They rustle against the window and an unrest / Of wings beats / Against my ears." In 1914, Pound published the poem "Riposte" in Poetry . This poem begins, "I have no hatred, I have no desire to fight / I have no quarrel with the world, I have no quarrel with the night." 

In 1914, Pound edited and published the anthology Des Imagistes , which included poems by himself, H.D., Aldington, Amy Lowell, and John Gould Fletcher. The following year, Pound published the anthology Some Imagist Poets . This anthology included poems by himself, H.D., Aldington, Fletcher, and Lowell. 

In 1915, H.D. and Aldington published the anthology Poems of This Century . This anthology included poems by themselves, Pound, Fletcher, and Lowell. 

In 1917, H.D. and Aldington published the anthology The New Age . This anthology included poems by themselves, Pound, Fletcher, Lowell

 The Imagists also produced a number of essays and manifestos . In their view , the prevailing literary taste , which they termed "Victorian , " was akin to the Victorian moral and aesthetic codes that had been swept away by the First World War . 

 Imagism was largely disbanded in 1917 , after the end of the First World War . Pound's interest in Chinese and Japanese poetry led him to the development of the ideogrammic method , which further distanced him from Imagism .

In 1893, Pound and H. D. (Hilda Doolittle) attended a lecture by the Pre-Raphaelite critic John Ruskin . Pound was greatly impressed by Ruskin 's emphasis on the visual , and he also began to admire the poetry of the 19th-century French Symbolist Charles Baudelaire .

> 1908 . The poems were described by F. S. Flint as "rhythmic and metrical experiments" . Pound and Hulme met in 1908 , and the two poets collaborated on the magazine Rhythm . Pound and Hulme were joined by Richard Aldington and F. S. Flint , who had been working with Hulme at the Poets' Club . Aldington was to become one of the leading members of the movement . The first Imagist manifesto was published in the London magazine Poetry and Society in April 1914 . The movement was named after the first line of Hulme's poem A City Sunset .

 The Imagists were opposed to the romanticism of the Victorian poets and wanted to write poetry that was more realistic . They rejected the use of adjectives and adverbs and believed that a poem should be concentrated and compact . They believed that the language of poetry should be modern and that it should be based on the rhythms of speech .

 The movement was a reaction to the excesses of Victorian poetry , which was considered to be over-decorated and over-emotional . Pound , in particular , believed that the Victorian poets had been writing about things that they had not experienced first-hand . He also believed that the poets had been using language in a way that was not natural to them . The Imagists were influenced by the French symbolists , who were also concerned with writing about real things .

 The Imagist poets were also influenced by Japanese art and literature . They believed that the Japanese had a more direct way of expressing themselves . The Imagist poets were also influenced by the work of the French poet Stéphane Mallarmé . Mallarmé was known for his use of symbolism and his interest in the visual arts .

> 12 Hulme's philosophical and poetic interests were to have a profound influence on Flint . Hulme's article was a defence of the principles of Imagism ; it was a clear statement of his own poetic aims and preoccupations . Hulme argued that the old Romantic poets had not understood the power of the imagination and that it was the task of the modern poet to make full use of the imagination . He attacked the Romantics for their tendency to over-emotionalise and to sentimentalise nature . He claimed that modern poets had to 'try to convey the essence of things' and that they had to 'make the abstract concrete' . He argued that the poet had to write 'about real things' and that he had to 'avoid the vague and the general' . He also rejected the Romantics' tendency to use words in a way that was remote from the objects they referred to . Hulme argued that the Romantics had been guilty of 'metaphorical over-eagerness' . The modern poet had to be more careful in his use of language and more aware of the objects he was describing . Hulme argued that the Romantic poets had often been guilty of using words in ways that were untrue to their actual meanings . He criticised Wordsworth for his use of the word 'heavenly' and argued that it was not an accurate description of the objects to which he referred . He argued that the modern poet had to 'avoid the vague and the general' . He believed that the Romantics had not understood the nature of the imagination and that they had failed to realise that it was the imagination that was the source of poetry . Hulme claimed that the Romantics had failed to understand that the imagination was the 'root of all perception' . He argued that the Romantics had failed to realise that 'the imagination is the organ by which we are conscious of the world' . He claimed that the Romantics had failed to understand that the imagination was 'the primary principle of our being' . He argued that the Romantics had failed to understand that the imagination was 'the essential principle of the poet's art' . He claimed that the Romantics had failed to understand that the imagination was 'the principle of beauty' . Hulme claimed that the Romantics had failed to understand that the imagination was 'the principle of love' . He argued

The Imagists ' style of poetry was intended to convey their meaning with the utmost clarity and directness , and to avoid the stilted language that they felt characterized much 19th-century poetry . 

The group published three anthologies of their poetry : Des Imagistes (1914), Some Imagist Poets (1915), and Poets of the New Rhythm (1916). The British Imagist poet H.D. was the only one of the group to gain a wide readership . In 1915 , the group published the first anthology of Imagist poetry , Des Imagistes , edited by Pound and H.D. . The anthology included poems by Pound , H.D. , Richard Aldington , Fiona Macleod , William Carlos Williams , and Lewis Ellingham . 

 Some Imagist Poets was a second anthology published in 1915 . Poets of the New Rhythm was the third anthology published by the group in 1916 .

In 1914 , the group disbanded . Pound continued to publish poetry that reflected his Imagist ideas , and he continued to publish the work of the other members of the group .

## Imagist poetry

The imagists had a wide range of poetic styles , but they shared a common approach to poetry and a common desire to move away from the 19th-century approach to poetry that they felt had led to the development of an overly stylized , rhetorical poetry . 

The group were influenced by the work of the French Symbolists , who were interested in the use of metaphor and symbolism in poetry . However , the imagists were particularly influenced by the work of the French poet Stéphane Mallarmé .

 In April 1913 , Pound began a correspondence with the American poet Amy Lowell , who was a patron of the Imagist movement , and also a supporter of H.D. and Aldington . Pound , in his capacity as foreign editor of Poetry , had been sending her Imagist poems by H.D. and Aldington . Lowell , however , was dissatisfied with Pound's judgement and sent H.D. and Aldington a letter of introduction to her . 

 In his introduction to H.D.'s collection Sea Garden ( 1916 ) , Pound had written of H.D. and Aldington that they were ' <unk> ' , a term which was taken to mean ' <unk> ' . 

 In 1916 , Pound wrote to Aldington that he was <unk> , and that he was <unk> .

 The second Imagist anthology , Poets of the New Era , was published in May 1913 by Duckworth and Company in London , and in November 1913 by Alfred A. Knopf in New York . The anthology included 13 poems by Aldington and 12 by H.D. , and 25 by Pound , including his own poems and translations from French , Italian , and Latin .

 The Imagists were not a formal group , but rather a loose association of poets who believed in the superiority of the visual image in poetry , and who were united by their rejection of the Victorian poetic tradition . The group was largely a British movement , although the United States poets H.D. and Amy Lowell were both influenced by the Imagists , and the group's impact was felt in the United States . The movement was founded by Ezra Pound , and its members included H.D. , Amy Lowell , Richard Aldington , F.S. Flint , John Gould Fletcher , D.H. Lawrence , H.D. 's husband Aldington , and the American poet Marianne Moore . The movement flourished from 1912 to 1917 .

 H.D. was a British-American poet associated with the Imagist movement . In 1913 , she met Ezra Pound in London , and he introduced her to Richard Aldington . In 1914 , H.D. and Aldington moved to Paris , where they met with other members of the Imagist movement . In 1916 , H.D. and Aldington returned to the United States .

 H.D. and Aldington both had a relationship with D.H. Lawrence , and Lawrence was also associated with the Imagists . In 1912 , Lawrence had published his first novel , The White Peacock , and in 1913 , he published his second novel , Sons and Lovers . Lawrence's third novel , The Rainbow , was published in 1915 .

Against the use of "literary" words , which separate the speaker from his subject , and instead of "going down into the cellar at night with a lantern" , "bringing up the passages of a text." Against the use of grammar .

 In September 1914 , the first issue of the magazine Poetry ( Chicago ) was published , containing the statement " For the New Verse " by Pound , which asserted that the aims of the imagists were : 

 To produce poetry that is music , not noise ;

 To achieve precision of rhythm , rhyme , and imagery ;

 To concentrate on the essence of immediate experience ;

 To eliminate all unnecessary words.

 Pound 's statement was not an announcement of a new movement , but a statement of the principles of imagism by a member of the group .

 The imagists were a loosely organized group . Pound and H. D. were the two most important members , and they were the ones who received the most attention in the press . The other members of the group , Flint , Moore , S. Foster Damon , and the American poets F. S. Flint , Richard Aldington , and H.D . , as well as the American poet Amy Lowell , also wrote poems that were influenced by imagism , but they were not formally associated with the group .

 A second group of writers , the Vorticists , were also influenced by the imagists . The Vorticists were a group of English writers , painters , and sculptors , who were associated with the magazine BLAST . The Vorticists believed that the art of the future would be based on the principles of Cubism and Futurism , and that this art would be based on the idea of " Vorticism " , which they defined as : 

 The expression of energy . 

 In 1914 , Pound published a statement of the principles of

 Pound 's second rule of composition was that of " make it new " . Pound describes this rule as " to make it new , make it good , make it true " . Pound goes on to state that " No poet , no artist of any art , has his complete meaning alone . No poet , no artist is interested merely in what he has to say , or what he has to invent.

### The first Imagist anthology

The first Imagist anthology was published in 1915, and edited by H.D. and Aldington. It was entitled Some Imagist Poets, and included poems by the main Imagist poets of the day, including Pound, H.D., Aldington, Amy Lowell, Richard Aldington, Flint, and others. It included the following statement from H.D. and Aldington:

"... Imagism is a poetic theory, and has been defined as the presentation of 'the image'—that is, of the thing, whether abstract or concrete. It is not an aesthetic theory, nor a critical theory, nor a psychological theory. It is a poetic theory, because the presentation of the image is the basic thing in poetry. The image is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time. It has the ability to take in the whole thing. It has the ability to be universal. It is concrete only as it is specific. It is the exact thing, the thing itself, without commentary, without qualification, the thing as it is seen in a moment. It is the thing that is the core of poetry. The image is not the theme. It is the immediate perception of the thing, the scent of the rose, the movement of the tiger, the light of the moon.

### Imagist Manifesto

In 1915, Pound published the Imagist Manifesto. The Manifesto was written in the form of a letter from Pound to Poetry magazine. In the Manifesto, Pound called for a new poetry that was "a direct treatment of the 'thing,' whether subjective or objective." He explained that Imagism was a "movement" that could be understood as a "collection of poems" or a "movement" or "school" of poetry. He criticized the poetry of the day as being too "confused" and "incoherent" and called for a poetry that was "a clear, hard, clear

 E.P.Thompson , who has written an excellent study of H.D. , in his 1977 book The Making of the English Working Class , has this to say about the Imagists in the early 20th century : " In the years between 1909 and 1914 the most important poets of the twentieth century were born : T.S. Eliot , H.D. , Ezra Pound , W.B. Yeats , W.H. Auden , James Joyce , and D.H. Lawrence . They were all born between 1880 and 1885 . They were all born into the period of the Industrial Revolution .

Pound 's essay , which was written in a formal style , was the first of many attacks on free verse . He argued that poetry should have a musical quality and that rhyme and rhythm were essential elements.

 The poets published in the final two anthologies were not all Imagists , but they were all influenced by the Imagist movement. The Imagist style was widely imitated by writers of all schools and movements , and it was not until the late 1920s that the movement began to be seen as the pioneer of Modernist poetry .

### The Return of the Imagists

In 1920, Harriet Monroe published an anthology called Poetry , and she included the work of several Imagists, including Pound, H.D., and Hulme. At the time, Pound was living in Paris and Hulme had recently died in London. In 1923, Pound published a new anthology, Des Imagistes , which was advertised as a “Revision of the 1914 Anthology,” and contained work by Pound, H.D., Hulme, and the French poet, Guillaume Apollinaire. In 1925, Pound published a collection of his own poems, Cathay, which included a number of poems in the Imagist style.

In 1926, Pound published a new anthology, Ripostes, which contained work by Pound, H.D., and the French poet, Blaise Cendrars. In 1928, Pound published a collection of his own poems, Twelve Rock Poems, which included a number of poems in the Imagist style.

In 1929, Pound published a new anthology, More Ripostes, which contained work by Pound, H.D., and the French poet, Paul Valéry. In 1930, Pound published a collection of his own poems, Exultations, which included a number of poems in the Imagist style.

In 1931, Pound published a new anthology, New Directions in Prose and Poetry, which contained work by Pound, H.D., and the French poet, Paul Valéry. In 1932, Pound published a collection of his own poems, Personae, which included a number of poems in the Imagist style.

H. D. , who has never been highly regarded as a poet , is remembered as an important novelist and biographer .

### Poetry and the modernist avant-garde

Certain poets who were not members of the Imagist group, but who shared a similar aesthetic, were also influenced by the Imagist movement. These included, in particular, British poet W. B. Yeats and French poet Guillaume Apollinaire. Both Yeats and Apollinaire were influenced by the poetic theories of the group and began to experiment with the Imagist style in their own work. Yeats was also influenced by the Imagist movement in his work on Irish mythology, and was a major influence on the development of modern Irish literature.

The Imagist movement had a significant influence on the development of modernist poetry, particularly in the United States. Modernist poets such as Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, and William Carlos Williams were influenced by the Imagist movement and began to experiment with the Imagist style in their own work. These poets, along with other modernist poets such as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Marianne Moore, were also influenced by the Imagist movement in their work on the modernist avant-garde.

### The influence of Imagism in the 21st century

In the 21st century, the influence of Imagism in poetry has continued to be felt, with many contemporary poets continuing to experiment with the Imagist style in their own work. Some contemporary poets who have been influenced by Imagism include:

* Les Murray
* David Morley
* John Burnside
* Kathleen Jamie
* Mark Strand
* Robert Creeley
* Mark Doty
* Billy Collins
* Louise Glück
* Charles Simic

 One of the most frequently cited criticisms of Imagism is that it was elitist and exclusive. In her introduction to the 1916 edition of Des Imagistes, H.D. defended the movement against such criticism, writing : " I think the real objection to Imagism is that it is difficult, and it is difficult because it is not a formula, but a point of view. It is not a school, but a method of thought. It is a method of thought which is not bound by any tradition, which does not regard any tradition as sacred, which does not set up any standard, and which does not accept any standard. It is not a school, but a point of view."

## Reception

Reception to Imagism was mixed. Many critics of the time criticized its apparent lack of a cohesive theory. Eliot himself said in his essay "Tradition and the Individual Talent" that Imagism was "an inadequate and unsatisfactory substitute for a complete theory of poetry." The poet, critic, and editor Ezra Pound, one of the founders of Imagism, would later say, "The Imagists have had their day. They were a school, and all schools are transient. But I believe that they were a good school."

The term "Imagist" itself was coined by the critic Edward Marsh, and was initially used to describe the poets Pound, Fletcher, and Hulme. Pound himself did not like the term, however, and in his essay "The Serious Artist" he wrote, "I don't want to be called an Imagist. I don't think that Imagism has any vital connection with poetry."

The first major public critique of Imagism was the 1916 essay "Imagisme" by the American poet H.D. In it, she takes issue with the movement's refusal to write about love and the emotional. Pound's response to H.D.'s critique was his essay "Riposte", which defended Imagism. Pound's essay was published in the 1917 issue of Poetry, which was edited by Harriet Monroe.

In 1917, the American poet and critic William Carlos Williams wrote his essay "The Use of Force in Poetry" which was a critique of Imagism. In it, he said, "I am not an Imagist. I am an objectivist. I have no sympathy with the Imagist movement. I do not believe in the use of esoteric words in poems. I believe in using words that are exact."

In 1920, the American poet and critic T.S. Eliot published his essay "The Metaphysical Poets" which was a critique of Imagism. In it

## Background

Pound's imagist manifesto

In 1913, Pound published his "Manifesto: The Seven Arts" in the American literary journal The Seven Arts . In it, he wrote that poetry should have the clarity of a Chinese ideogram, that it should be precise and direct, that it should have no superfluous words, that it should be concrete, and that it should be the image of an emotional experience. Pound further proposed that poems should be written in short, well-defined stanzas that would reflect the rhythm of speech and that would be neither rhymed nor metered.

H.D.'s "Sea Poppies" (1912)

The first imagist poem published in America was H.D.'s "Sea Poppies" (1912), which was also the first poem published in Poetry: A Magazine of Verse . H.D. was an important figure in the Imagist movement. She was a close friend of Pound's, and he was her first and most important editor.

The first imagist poems were published in Poetry: A Magazine of Verse in 1913. The magazine was edited by Harriet Monroe , who was a friend of H.D. and Pound. The first issue of the magazine, in which H.D.'s poem was published, was dated September 1912. In the same issue, Pound published the first Imagist manifesto. In the manifesto, he wrote, "A poem should not mean / But be." Pound's manifesto was a response to what he saw as the decline of poetry in the 19th century. He believed that poetry should be direct, clear, and concrete.

H.D.'s "The God" (1913)

Pound's manifesto had a profound effect on the Imagist movement. H.D. was one of the first poets to embrace the Imagist style. Her poem "The God

## Background

The Somali Civil War began in 1991 after President Siad Barre was ousted from power and Somalia was divided into factions, primarily along clan lines. In 1991, Somalia was a failed state, with no effective central government. There was no police force and no law and order, and the country had been ravaged by years of civil war. In December 1990, the United Nations Security Council voted to establish a UN peacekeeping force in Somalia, and in March 1991, the UN authorized the deployment of 4,000 troops to Somalia, which became known as the United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM I).

The United States government's involvement in Somalia began in 1992, when President George H. W. Bush authorized the deployment of U.S. troops to Somalia to provide security for the UN peacekeeping force. This led to the Battle of Mogadishu, in which 18 American soldiers were killed and 73 were wounded.

## Operation

On 1 January 1991, the United States Embassy in Mogadishu was evacuated. The operation was carried out by the United States Army's 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Task Force Eagle). The operation was named Eastern Exit by the US Army and took place in the early hours of 3 January 1991. The operation was planned by the 1st Battalion's intelligence officer, Capt. John W. Ripley, who was later awarded the Silver Star for his planning and execution of the operation.

The operation began at approximately 01:00 on 3 January, with the 1st Battalion moving out of the embassy compound. The operation was conducted in darkness and was planned to last no more than 30 minutes. The operation was conducted in two phases: the first phase was a fast-moving, high-speed assault, and the second phase was a slow-moving, deliberate withdrawal. The operation was conducted with minimal casualties, with only one American soldier killed

The embassy staff and equipment loaded into the two C-141s was transported to the US base at Masirah , in Oman , which was the nearest airbase with an airstrip long enough to handle the planes . It took three days to transport the cargo from Mogadishu to Masirah , which was the first stop on the journey to the United States .

It's almost like the band were so busy having fun that they forgot to make sure everything was in order." 


 Robert Christgau of the Village Voice gave the album a "C+" grade, saying, "She's a hothead, and she's on her way to becoming a star. It's her pop songs that are the problem, as these are all written by outsiders, and they all sound like the same song." 


 Gareth Von Kallenbach of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "Alejandro Sanz is the hottest star in the Spanish-speaking world, and his latest album proves why. His voice is a dark, smoky tenor that makes him sound like a Spanish-language Frank Sinatra, and the album has a sexy, Latin-jazz vibe." 


 Adrian Deevoy of Q wrote, "It's hard to imagine a more sexily seductive album than this. With its seductive beats and sultry Spanish lyrics, it's a superbly seductive album. The Latin grooves are the beating heart of this record, and Sanz's sultry voice is a magnificent instrument." 


 Mónica Ramírez of El Mundo wrote, "Sanz is a Latin-American musical genius. With Independiente, he has become a great pop star. His work is more than a collection of songs, but a musical universe that is very exciting and different from the usual. He is the most original artist in the Spanish-speaking world, and his album is a great work of art."

 The 2013 Pacific typhoon season officially started on May 15 and lasted until November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean . A tropical cyclone is typically referred to as a typhoon in the North Pacific , but is referred to as a tropical storm in the South Pacific and is called a cyclone in the Indian Ocean . Tropical depressions are severe tropical storms with sustained winds of 33 knots (61 km/h; 38 mph) or less . In addition , the Japan Meteorological Agency also assigns international names to tropical cyclones that form in the northwestern Pacific .
The name Linfa was assigned by the PAGASA to a tropical cyclone in the Western Pacific that entered or crossed the Philippine Area of Responsibility . The name was contributed by Vietnam and is the Vietnamese word for "water spirit" .
The 2013 Pacific typhoon season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation . It was a below average season with 18 tropical cyclones . The season's first named storm developed on May 15 . Tropical cyclone formation was suppressed during the first half of the season due to the presence of a strong monsoonal ridge over the Northwestern Pacific . This caused a lack of significant tropical cyclone activity until late June . After the monsoonal ridge weakened in early July , tropical cyclone formation increased significantly . In total , 18 tropical cyclones developed during the season . The strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Typhoon Wipha , which had 10 - minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) .
In addition to tropical cyclones , the Japan Meteorological Agency also monitors two areas in the northwestern Pacific where tropical depressions form . This area is the western North Pacific west of the International Date Line . The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center also uses the JTWC's warning criteria for tropical cyclones , except for tropical storms . If a tropical

 Extratropical cyclone, remnant low, tropical disturbance, or monsoon depression

The precursor to Tropical Storm Linfa originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on April 25 . The wave was monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) as it tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. On May 13 , the JTWC began to monitor the disturbance as a tropical depression, while the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression the next day. Upon the depression's formation, the JTWC designated it as Tropical Depression 01W, while the JMA designated it as Tropical Depression 01W. At 0000 UTC on May 15, the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Linfa.

## Preparations and impact

Linfa caused moderate to heavy rainfall in the Philippines, leading to the death of 41 people and the destruction of 2,000 homes. The storm also brought strong winds to Taiwan.

The origins of Typhoon Maemi can be traced to a tropical depression that developed on July 23, 1999, to the north of the International Date Line, roughly 660 km (410 mi) northeast of Guam. The storm moved west-northwestward, and intensified into a typhoon on July 24. The JTWC classified it as Tropical Storm 09W, while the JMA designated it as a typhoon, and named it Maemi. After intensifying to a Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale, Maemi reached its peak intensity on July 27, with maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). The typhoon then turned to the northwest, and then began to weaken. Maemi became extratropical on July 29, and was last noted as a

Politics : In a move that surprised many, the South Korean government has decided to end its state of emergency on May 11th. This decision was made despite the fact that the country has seen a recent surge in cases of the coronavirus.
The government had previously extended the state of emergency twice, most recently on April 23rd. However, with the number of new cases now falling, the government has decided to lift the emergency.
This decision has been met with some criticism, as some people feel that the country is not doing enough to protect its citizens from the virus. However, the government has defended its decision, saying that the state of emergency was never intended to be a long-term solution.
It will be interesting to see how the country deals with the virus going forward, and whether or not the government's decision to lift the state of emergency will have any impact on the situation.

On September 16, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring an area of low pressure over the South China Sea. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system, noting that it had become sufficiently organized to be designated as Tropical Depression 15W. The system intensified to tropical storm strength later that day, and was named Choi @-@ wan by the JMA. The storm was initially moving west-northwestward, and it passed over the Philippines on September 19.

Choi @-@ wan was not expected to intensify significantly, and the JTWC only expected the system to reach typhoon status. However, as the system moved into the Philippine Sea, it intensified rapidly, and the JTWC upgraded it to typhoon status on September 21. On September 22, the JTWC upgraded it to super typhoon status, with winds of 250 km/h (160 mph). The JMA estimated that Choi @-@ w

The origins of Typhoon Lupit can be traced back to a weak tropical depression that developed on November 22. The depression gradually intensified into a tropical storm and was named Lupit by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on November 24. Later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm. On November 25, the storm intensified into a typhoon. On November 26, Lupit attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), while the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 90 mph (145 km/h). Lupit weakened to a tropical

The two Austrian divisions under Franz von Weyrother were scheduled to cross the Danube on the morning of October 16 and were already on their way . If the Austrians could cross the river and get to Elchingen before Ney could capture the bridge , the Austrians would be able to push Ney back across the river and thus separate the French army into two groups . It was now October 15 , and Ney was determined to prevent this separation . The only thing standing between the French and the separation was the Elchingen bridge . Ney sent orders to General Claude-Étienne Michel , commander of the 1st Bavarian Reserve Corps , to attack Elchingen and to capture the bridge . Michel , who had already participated in the retreat from Ulm , was eager to participate in the advance to Elchingen .

The region of the county of Stein had been the scene of much fighting in the past , but in the 1860s it was a quiet and peaceful place , with the main concern being the advancement of the county 's citizens and the prosperity of the town of Krems . The county of Stein was the most populous of the 15 counties of Lower Austria , and it was the second largest in size , after the county of Gmünd . The county of Stein had been formed in 1867 by the merger of the county of Krems and the county of Stein , which had been the most populous of the 15 counties of Upper Austria . 

In the 1860s , Krems was a busy and bustling town with a population of about 5,000 people . It had a market square with a number of shops and businesses , and it was a center of trade and commerce for the surrounding countryside . The town had a number of important buildings , including the church of St. Nikolaus , which was the largest church in the county of Stein . The church had a tall tower and a beautiful bell , which could be heard ringing throughout the town . 

The town of Krems had a number of important businesses , including a large brewery , a distillery , and a tannery . The brewery was one of the largest in the country , and it produced a wide range of beers , including a popular dark beer called Schwarzbier . The distillery was known for its high-

## Aftermath

Napoleon 's plan of action was to have the main body of the French army cross the river at Braunau , while a separate force under Mortier and Gazan was to follow a shorter route through the mountains . The Russians , however , had anticipated this manoeuvre and had occupied the heights of Aspern , which commanded the passage of the Danube at Braunau . Napoleon , therefore , had to split his forces , placing Mortier and Gazan on the left bank and ordering the main body to cross at the Danube 's lower end .

On 20 June , the 3rd Corps under Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte crossed at the lower end and marched on the village of Aspern . Meanwhile , Mortier and Gazan were marching from Braunau and had reached the Danube by nightfall . On 21 June , Bernadotte 's corps attacked the village of Aspern , which was defended by the 1st Grenadier Division of the Russian army . After a desperate struggle , the French were finally forced to withdraw .

Meanwhile , Mortier and Gazan had crossed the Danube at Wagram and were marching on the Russian army . On 21 June , they encountered the Russian cavalry and were forced to engage them . After a series of skirmishes , the French were finally driven back and were forced to halt on the banks of the Danube . The next day , the Russians attacked the French positions and were repulsed .

In the summer of 1809 , the French army under Napoleon marched from Vienna to the Austrian capital . The Austrian army under Archduke Charles of Austria and Prince Schwarzenberg withdrew to the east . Napoleon’s army split into two parts : the first , under Marshal Davout , was ordered to cross the Danube at Krems and capture Vienna ; the second , under Marshal Lannes , was to cross the Danube at Dürrenstein and follow up the retreat of the Austrians . The French army crossed the Danube at Dürrenstein on June 6 .

 The Russian and Austrian forces were in a position to attack Gazan 's force at any moment . Gazan ordered his troops to dig in and make preparations to receive the expected attack . The Russians and Austrians made no move . The French position was too strong to attack , and the Allies had no wish to engage in battle . 

 As the day wore on , Gazan 's force became more and more nervous . The French position was well dug in and protected by a stream that ran through the valley . The only way that the French could be attacked was by moving across the river . 

 The Austrians were the first to attempt to cross the river . They were driven back with heavy losses by the Russian Jägers . The Austrians were forced to withdraw to the other side of the river . 

 At nightfall , Gazan was able to withdraw his force to the safety of the Russian and Austrian lines .

 The Russian plan of attack was simple . The Russian forces were to wait until Gazan arrived , and then attack the French in the valley below . The French would have a very difficult time of defending their positions with the Russians on the hills above . After the French were defeated , Kutuzov would then attack the French main body .

 Kutuzov hoped to achieve a decisive victory over the French , and then move on to Vienna . However , the French were too well prepared . The French position was too strong for the Russians to attack , and the Russians could not cross the river to attack the French in the valley .

 Dupont , who had heard the news , had already taken his corps out of the line of battle and was marching southwest toward Hohenlinden , where he expected to join the army . As he advanced , he was joined by General Hull and the troops of the 2nd Corps . Hull was informed of the Emperor's movements and of the battle in progress . He therefore advanced rapidly to the south and took a position on the road to Munich , between the French and the enemy , but did not get into action . 

 The Emperor , who had arrived at Landshut , sent General Gourgaud to find out what had happened . Gourgaud found Dupont and Hull at Hohenlinden , where the Emperor joined them . He had been informed of the situation by the courier who had arrived with the news of the Emperor's approach . He had not yet heard of the battle , and was not certain that the courier was reliable .

> the final analysis , the most significant of these was the Austrian defeat at Austerlitz in December 1805 . This was the decisive action of the war , in which the French under Napoleon destroyed the main Austrian army at the Battle of Austerlitz . In this engagement , Napoleon's forces inflicted a decisive defeat on the Austrians , who were forced to surrender 15,000 men and 28 guns . Napoleon's other major land victory was the Battle of Ulm in October 1805 , in which the French destroyed the main Bavarian army under Archduke Ferdinand . The two main French defeats were the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 , which cost the French 15,000 casualties in a failed invasion attempt of Britain , and the Battle of Dürenstein in November 1805 , in which the French lost 15,000 men to the Russians in the Danube valley . 

The War of the Third Coalition was a series of military operations , including major battles and sieges , that were fought in Western Europe from September 1805 to October 1806 . The war pitted the French Empire against the Third Coalition , which consisted of the United Kingdom , the Kingdom of Portugal , the Kingdom of Prussia , the Russian Empire , the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire . The French victory in the war marked the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and resulted in the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine , a French satellite state that comprised much of western Germany . The war was a continuation of the War of the Second Coalition , which ended with the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801 . The Treaty of Pressburg , which was signed by the French and Austrian representatives on 26 December 1805 , ended the war . 

The war began when Napoleon invaded Austria in September 1805 and defeated the main Austrian army at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805 .

The French retreated after a Moscow fire destroyed the city; Napoleon's army was decimated by the harsh Russian climate and lack of supplies. The Russian army, led by Mikhail Kutuzov , did not follow up the French retreat. The campaign ended with the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, where Napoleon was defeated by a coalition army commanded by the Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher , the Austrian Archduke Charles and the Russian field marshal Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly .

## Background

Main article: French invasion of Austria

On 20 October 1805 , an army of 80,000 French troops crossed the Inn River into Austria , led by Napoleon Bonaparte . The main Austrian force, 70,000 strong, was led by Archduke Charles , commander of the Austrian Army . The two armies collided on 20 October at the Battle of Ulm , and the Austrian army was forced to retreat. The French pursued the retreating Austrians, and on 11 November , the French army arrived at Dürenstein , a village about 60 km (37 mi) west of Vienna . 

## Battle

On 11 November , the French launched an assault on the Austrian positions on a wooded hill near Dürenstein. The Austrian forces, led by General Johann von Hiller , defended the hill in a strong position. The French were unable to break through, and the Austrian artillery fire was particularly effective. In the end, the French lost 1,800 men killed or wounded, and the Austrians lost 600. The battle was the first time Napoleon had encountered a determined enemy who could withstand his attacks. 

## Aftermath

On 12 November, the French withdrew from the battlefield, and the Austrians were able to regroup. The next day, the Austrians attacked and routed the French, who were forced to retreat. This defeat marked the end of the French invasion of Austria, and it was a turning point in the Napoleonic Wars.

 Hohenlohe ordered the Austrian infantry to attack the first line of Russian defenses. The Austrian artillery opened fire, and the infantry advanced to within 200 meters of the Russian positions, whereupon they were met by a withering fire from Russian cannons and infantry. The Austrian infantry suffered heavy losses, and after an hour and a half of fighting, the Austrians retreated to their own lines. Hohenlohe then ordered the Austrian cavalry to charge the Russian positions, but they too were met with a fierce Russian fire and were forced to retreat. Hohenlohe then ordered the Austrian artillery to bombard the Russian positions, but this too was ineffective. Finally, Hohenlohe ordered the Austrian infantry to attack again, but they were once again met with heavy Russian fire and were forced to retreat.

## Professional wrestling career

### Early career

Lesnar was trained by the legendary shoot fighter Dan Severn. Lesnar also trained with former professional wrestlers, most notably Bill Goldberg.

#### Debut and early feuds (2002–2003)

Lesnar made his WWE debut on 17 June 2002 at the age of 25. He initially appeared as a villain, with the character Paul Heyman (of ECW fame) claiming to be Lesnar's manager and advocating that Lesnar should be the #1 contender to the WWE Championship. Heyman's claims were met with skepticism by Vince McMahon, who was already booking Lesnar in his first WWE match. On 25 June, Lesnar defeated Jeff Hardy at Vengeance. After the match, Lesnar attacked Hardy, who was still in the ring, and attempted to apply the Kimura lock. The following night on Raw, Lesnar was given a match against Hardy, but after the match, he attacked Hardy again, this time locking in the Kimura. Heyman claimed that the Kimura was the only hold that Lesnar knew. In a match against Hardy on 15 July at The Great American Bash, Lesnar won by disqualification after Hardy was hit with a steel chair. The match was restarted as a "No Holds Barred" match, which Lesnar won by disqualification again after Hardy was hit with a chair again.

> 1920s US Navy , and were used in the 1930s in radio receivers . The Campbell filter was used for the first time in the 1930s and was popular until the 1950s .

## Description

The Campbell filter is a low-pass filter with a single resistor and two capacitors . The resistor and capacitors are connected in series .

The resistance of the circuit can be calculated using the formula:

\[R={\frac {2C}{1+{\sqrt {2}}C}}\]

and the capacitors can be calculated using the formula:

\[C={\frac {R}{2{\sqrt {2}}}}\]

### Formulas

The following formulas can be used to calculate the values of the capacitors and resistance of the Campbell filter:

\[{\begin{aligned}C&=\left({\frac {R}{2{\sqrt {2}}}}\right)&&\left({\frac {R}{2{\sqrt {2}}}}\right)&=\left({\frac {2C}{1+{\sqrt {2}}C}}\right)\\R&={\frac {2C}{1+{\sqrt {2}}C}}&&\left({\frac {2C}{1+{\sqrt {2}}C}}\right)&={\frac {R}{2{\sqrt {2}}}}\end{aligned}}\]

### Graphical representation

In addition , the use of the constant k technique has been extended to the design of filters for the frequency response of which the poles are located inside the unit circle . These filters are referred to as fractional constant k filters . The term fractional constant k refers to the fact that the constant k is not a rational number but rather a fraction . In this article , we show that the fractional constant k technique can be used to design fractional band stop filters . The fractional band stop filter is a filter which has a frequency response of which the poles are located inside the unit circle but with a fractional stop band . In the literature , the fractional band stop filter is also referred to as a fractional stop band filter . The fractional band stop filter can be used to attenuate the signals which lie inside the stop band of the filter . In this article , we show that the fractional band stop filter can be used to attenuate the signals which lie inside the pass band of the filter .

### High pass filters

High pass filters are the mirror image of low pass filters. They pass higher frequencies but attenuate lower frequencies. High pass filters are used to block unwanted low frequencies and pass the high frequency content of the signal. High pass filters are used in audio equalizers to separate the bass frequencies from the treble frequencies.

> ises and the discovery of the Doctor's past in " The Angels Take Manhattan ", the episode was developed by lead writer Steven Moffat with the intention of being a "bigger, better, more emotional" version of the Doctor's previous Christmas special, " The Runaway Bride " ( 2006 ). It was produced by Marcus Wilson and directed by Toby Haynes , who had previously directed " The Angels Take Manhattan " and " The God Complex " . Moffat's treatment of the Doctor's past was inspired by the work of author Neil Gaiman , whose Doctor Who novels feature the Doctor in an "almost gothic" adventure. Moffat and Gaiman's script was inspired by the Doctor's 2010 story " The Vampires of Venice " , which they felt "got the tone of the show right". 

The episode was filmed in November 2012, with the director and most of the cast returning from " The Angels Take Manhattan ". The script and direction were influenced by the film The Thing ( 1982 ), with the snowmen intended to be a "terrifying" version of the Doctor's companions. The episode was highly anticipated by the media and fans, and was considered by many to be one of the best of the series' seventh series. Critics praised the acting, direction, writing, and the episode's emotional impact, but some felt it was "overly sentimental" and that it suffered from the absence of the Doctor's companions.

## Plot

## Production

### Writing

Steven Moffat wrote the episode and has said that he felt the Doctor "needed to go on a journey" in the episode.

Moffat has said that he wanted to write a story which would explore the relationship between the Doctor and Clara, and was inspired by his own experiences of moving in with a girlfriend. He said that he wanted to write a story which would be "very funny, but also very emotional and very serious", and that he wanted to write a story that would "show the Doctor's humanity, and how it's something that's in all of us".

Moffat also said that he wanted to write a story which would explore the theme of identity, and would show how the Doctor is "the last of his kind", and that he wanted to write a story which would be "a Doctor Who story for people who don't like Doctor Who". He also said that he wanted to write a story which would be "about the Doctor being scared". Moffat also said that he wanted to write a story which would have a "fresh and exciting" monster.

### Casting

Moffat originally wanted to cast the actor David Bradley to play the role of the Doctor, and wrote the part with him in mind. He had previously written the role of William Hartnell in " The Doctor's Wife " for Bradley, and said that "I just wanted to write him into the part again". However, he was forced to abandon this idea after Bradley was cast in the role of the First Doctor for the 50th anniversary special.

The role of the Doctor was written for Matt Smith, who was also the executive producer on the episode. Moffat said that he was "very, very proud" to have written a story which featured Smith's Doctor. The role of the Doctor was also written for Clara Oswald, played by Jenna-Louise Coleman. Moffat said that he had been "very, very keen" to write a story for Coleman's character, and that he wanted to write a story which would show how the Doctor was "the last of his kind". Moffat also said that he wanted to write a story which would be "a Doctor Who story for people who don't like Doctor Who".

> ctors are the same and different, with the Doctor commenting on the previous Doctors and their various attributes. Moffat had intended to write the episode as a one-hander, with only the Doctor and Clara in the episode. The decision to include the Ponds was made after discussions with Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill. Moffat also considered writing the episode as a pastiche of a 1970s Doctor Who story, but ultimately decided against it. Moffat and director Saul Metzstein discussed using the style of the 1970s story The Ark, which would have seen the Doctor and Clara stranded on an alien planet with a " crazy, unstable Doctor", but Moffat decided against this idea as it did not fit with the tone of the episode. The Doctor's speech about the " perfect Doctor " was initially written for the Doctor to say to himself, but Moffat decided it was more interesting to have the Doctor talking to another person, and Clara was chosen as the recipient. The Doctor's speech about the previous Doctors was written to be a " history lesson" that explained the show to new viewers.

 Filming took place at the Forest of Dean , with a section of the episode being filmed at the village of Cinderford . The TARDIS console room was also filmed in Cinderford. The episode was filmed in mid-July 2012. The graveyard scenes were filmed at the Llanarthne Churchyard in Carmarthenshire , Wales . The location was chosen for its similarities to the churchyard in the village of Farringham, which was used for filming the 1972 story The Three Doctors. The village of Llanarthne was used as a stand-in for the village of Farringham.

For the 50th anniversary, Moffat decided to write an episode about the Doctor's death, and in the process thought about the Doctor's deaths in general. He said, " I always thought it was a good idea that the Doctor was immortal, and I thought it was a good idea that he was the last of his kind. The idea of the Doctor being the last Time Lord is a very good one, and I thought it would be interesting if he had been a Time Lord once, and then he'd been the last one. And that's why I decided that he was going to die.
Television critic Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave the episode four out of five stars, saying that the story " is a tribute to the Doctor's longevity, his regenerative powers and, above all, his capacity to remain cheerful in the face of annihilation. " He compared the episode to the 1996 film Independence Day , writing that " the Doctor 's unquenchable optimism is the film 's gripping subtext " and that " The Doctor 's realisation that he 's not alone is the key to the episode's emotional punch. " Mulkern praised the scene in which the Doctor meets himself and his companions, saying that " it 's a joy to see the Doctor at his most happy, his most confident and, in fact, his most Doctor-like. " He concluded that " the episode is a triumph, and a fitting finale to Matt Smith 's tenure. "
The episode was watched by 10.22 million viewers overnight, with a 47% share of the total television audience. It was the second most watched programme of the week, behind the Britain's Got Talent final. The overnight figure was an increase of 0.31 million on the previous episode.

The Doctor and Clara land on a snowy street in Victorian London. They are greeted by a mysterious, blue-eyed snowman, who identifies himself as the Great Intelligence. The Doctor explains that the Intelligence is an alien entity, trapped in a time loop. The snowman leads them to the TARDIS, which has been frozen in time and space. The Doctor frees the TARDIS, but is shocked to find the time rotor spinning backwards. The TARDIS is heading for a point in time and space where it will be destroyed. The Doctor and Clara travel to a nearby Victorian estate and find that the house is filled with snow. The Intelligence has been manipulating the weather to ensure that it can reach the TARDIS. The Doctor's knowledge of the house is corrupted, and he believes the house to be a church. The Doctor and Clara are attacked by the housekeeper, Mrs Gillyflower, who reveals that she is a hive mind with a hive of weeping angels inside her.

The Doctor and Clara escape the house and travel to the estate's stables, where they find a box containing the remains of the 12th Doctor, who has been dead for several centuries. The Doctor realises that the Intelligence has been using the Doctor's body to travel through time, and that the Intelligence is responsible for the Doctor's death. The Doctor and Clara return to the house, where they are attacked by a group of the house's occupants. The Doctor is captured by the housekeeper, but Clara is able to escape.

### Writing

In 2012, the BBC announced that the 2012 Christmas special would be a two-part story, with the first part written by Steven Moffat and the second part written by Mark Gatiss. The first part was directed by Saul Metzstein, and the second part was directed by Steven Moffat. Moffat was asked about the choice to do a two-part special, and he said: "I'm sure that's a choice that will be criticised. But, actually, it's a choice that's made for the best reason: we couldn't fit it into one episode. It's a great story and I'd rather have two great episodes than one great episode." He also stated that the episode would "have a lot of ghosts".

Moffat said the idea for the episode came from an idea he had in 1999, when he was writing the episode " The Unquiet Dead " for the first series of the revived Doctor Who. He said that he was "fascinated by the idea of the ghosts of Christmas" and had wanted to write a story about Christmas ghosts for years. Moffat said that the story would be a "Christmas treat" for the viewers. In December 2012, Moffat revealed that the episode was based on the 1843 novella A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. Moffat also said that the episode would be "the most Christmassy of Christmas

Moffat also considered David Morrissey , who had previously played a Dalek in " Asylum of the Daleks" , for the role of the Doctor , but was not available for filming .
On 23 July 2013 , Peter Capaldi was announced as the Twelfth Doctor . Moffat described Capaldi as " a genius , an actor of global renown and a star of screen , theatre and television " , and said that " Peter's eerily appropriate audition for Doctor Who proved that sometimes the best actors for a job aren't always the obvious choices . But if anyone had " Doctor Who " in mind when they thought of the Twelfth Doctor , it's Peter Capaldi .
On 10 April 2014 , Jenna Coleman was announced as the Doctor's companion , Clara Oswald , who had previously appeared in " Asylum of the Daleks" , " The Bells of Saint John" , " The Name of the Doctor" , and " Last Christmas" . Coleman had previously auditioned for the role of the Doctor , and had been a favourite of Moffat's since the beginning of the casting process . Moffat described her as " incredible " , and said that she was the " perfect match for Peter's Doctor " . In May 2014 , Samuel Anderson was cast as Danny Pink , a teacher at the school where Clara teaches . Anderson had previously appeared in " The Lodger" and " Closing Time" as Craig Owens , a friend of the Doctor .
On 18 November 2014 , the BBC announced that the series would return to Saturday nights in September 2015 , with the first episode being broadcast at 8:25 pm . The decision to move the programme to Saturday nights was made by Moffat , who believed that the series was more suitable for a Saturday night slot , and that the programme was " the BBC's flagship Saturday night show " .

The Woomera area had been selected for the testing of the British V bomber , the Avro Vulcan , in the early 1950s , and the base was officially opened in 1954 . The Vulcan was operated by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , which in 1964 decided to withdraw its nuclear-armed V-bombers from service .
In 1966, the RAF proposed that the base be transferred to the RAAF , which was more interested in using the base for the testing of its own aircraft . The government approved the proposal in 1968 and the RAF withdrew in 1970 , leaving the RAAF in charge of the base . Woomera Village was established in 1969 to house the personnel employed at the base .
The base was originally intended to be a joint service base, with the RAAF and RAN sharing it , but the RAN withdrew from the arrangement in 1971 . The base was subsequently used for the testing of the General Dynamics F-111 and General Dynamics YF-16 .
In the 1970s and 1980s , the base was used to test the HP Hercules , Tupolev Tu-142 and Tupolev Tu-22M , as well as the General Dynamics F-111 and General Dynamics YF-16 . It was also used to test the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and the McDonnell Douglas A-4 Skyhawk .
In the 1990s , the base was used to test the Boeing B-1B Lancer and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor . In 1994 , it was also used to test the Lockheed Martin F-117 Nighthawk .
The base has been used to test a number of other aircraft , including the Bell UH-1 Iroquois , Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion , Fairchild-Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II , McDonnell

## History

The squadron was formed on 12 January 2015 as part of the 2014 Force Structure Review , which saw the disbandment of No. 38 Squadron and the establishment of a new No. 20 Squadron and No. 82 Wing . The new units were formed to provide "the Australian Defence Force (ADF) with a more agile, networked, and integrated space capability" , with the two units to be supported by the newly established No. 3 Space Support Squadron .

The squadron's first commander was Group Captain Michael O'Brien , who was appointed on 14 May 2015 . O'Brien was succeeded by Group Captain Matt Sawford on 20 May 2016.

The Tetrarch was first used in action in the North African Campaign during the late 1941 and early 1942 . Although the tank had some successes in the desert , it was soon withdrawn from front line service due to its mechanical problems . The Tetrarch was later used as an armored car and as an artillery tractor .

 The 6th Airlanding Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was towed to Arnhem by 20 C-47s . This was the first time that British tanks had been towed by transport aircraft . 

 When the tanks arrived at Arnhem , the C-47s could not land due to the presence of enemy aircraft . The tanks were then unloaded by a rope and winch . 

 The tanks were then towed into the Arnhem bridgehead . A Tetrarch tank of the 2nd Battalion, 6th Airlanding Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment , became the first British tank to enter Arnhem . The tanks were used to support the British paratroopers in the city . 

 Tetrarchs of the 6th Airlanding Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment were deployed to North Africa in late 1944 . 

 The Tetrarch was used as a training tank by the British Army until 1947 . 

 The Tetrarch was the only British tank to be used in the Battle of the Bulge . It was also used in the Rhine crossing and the crossing of the River Elbe . 

 Tetrarchs were used by the 10th Armoured Division to support the 8th Armoured Brigade in the assault on the German city of Nuremberg . 

 The Tetrarch was also used in the Korean War by the British Commonwealth forces .

## Design and development

The Tetrarch was a British cruiser tank developed by Nuffield Mechanizations and Aero Ltd in 1939. It was designed to complement the light cruiser tanks (LCTs) then being developed by Vickers-Armstrongs, and was intended to fill the gap between the LCTs and the infantry tanks (ITs) then in service with the British Army. The Tetrarch was the first British tank to use the Christie suspension, which was lighter and more compact than the leaf spring suspension used on the LCTs.

The Tetrarch was a light cruiser tank with a crew of four and was armed with a 2-pounder (40 mm) gun in a fully rotating turret. It was powered by a petrol-fuelled engine and had a maximum speed of 48 km/h (30 mph).

### Production

The first prototype was delivered in March 1940, and was tested against the LCTs and the tankette Mk VI. The tank was found to be underpowered, with a top speed of 32 km/h (20 mph) and a range of 140 km (87 mi). In July 1940, the first production Tetrarchs were delivered to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France.

In 1940, the British War Office placed an order for 1,000 Tetrarchs. The first 100 were delivered in May 1941.

### Combat

The Tetrarchs were used in North Africa, where they were outclassed by the German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks. The Tetrarchs were also used in the campaigns in Italy, where they were used as infantry tanks.

The Tetrarchs were also used by the British Army in the Middle East and North Africa.

### Post-war

After the war, the Tetrarchs were replaced by the Crusader and Cromwell cruiser tanks.

### Surviving vehicles

> 1916 . The results were favourable , but the War Office was still concerned about the cost and the complexity of the system and the risk of its failure in battle .

 The War Office placed an order for a batch of 100 tanks to be built by Vickers at Elswick , Newcastle upon Tyne , but the order was cancelled in August 1916 , on the grounds that the tank was too expensive to produce and the War Office had decided to go ahead with the construction of the first Mark I tanks .

 The Vickers tank design was used in the A1E1 Independent , a prototype armoured car built by Vickers in 1917 . The Independent was a two-wheeled vehicle with two 100 hp (75 kW) V8 Wolseley engines driving the two rear wheels . It was armed with a 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun and a 0.50 in (12.7 mm) Maxim gun .

 narodni.hr. 1938 ; the model was tested as a possible " light cruiser " since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the Nuffield A13 offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . Despite this , it was decided that it was essential for some Tetrarchs to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program . Accordingly , the War Off ice agreed to a production run of 250 vehicles . narodni.hr. 

## Background

The Tetrarch was the result of a decision to produce a new light cruiser tank with a speed of at least 30 mph (48 km/h). The Tetrarch was intended to replace the Matilda II. The Tetrarch was to be a light cruiser with speed, firepower, and armor to match the Matilda. The Tetrarch was also intended to be a development of the Mk V.

The Tetrarch was the first tank to be designed by the Mechanical Warfare Supply Department.

## Design

The Tetrarch was designed to be a fast-moving tank, with a weight of 13 tons (12.7 tonnes) and a speed of 30 mph (48 km/h). This was achieved by using a lighter gun, a smaller turret, and a smaller engine. The gun was the 2 pounder (40 mm), which was a smaller version of the QF 2 pounder (40 mm) gun that was used on the Matilda. The turret was smaller than the Matilda's turret, and the engine was a 300 horsepower (220 kW) engine, which was smaller than the Matilda's engine.

The Tetrarch's armor was thinner than the Matilda's, and it was not as well armored. The Tetrarch's armor was 14 mm (0.55 in) thick, compared to the Matilda's 25 mm (0.98 in) thick armor. The Tetrarch'

> in July 1940 , and the delay was extended until September 1940 . Production was further delayed by the need for a new turret , the need for a new engine , and the need for an improved suspension . The War Office also wanted a new name for the tank , but Vickers Armstrong rejected all of the names the War Office proposed , so the tank was designated Matilda II in September 1940 . The name was chosen from a list of names that the War Office had prepared for tanks in the early 1930s .

The first Matilda II was delivered to the War Office on 30 May 1941 . Deliveries continued until the end of the war .

### Armour

The Matilda II's armour was originally 12 mm (0.47 in) thick , but was later increased to 25 mm (0.98 in) . The increase in armour was a direct result of the Battle of France , when the tanks used by the British Army were severely outmatched by the armour on the German tanks . The increase in armour was not without its own problems . The increase in armour made the tank top-heavy , and so the Matilda II's suspension was improved . The new suspension was not ready until June 1942 . The Matilda II was also used by the Polish Army , and the Poles requested that the tank's armour be increased to 32 mm (1.26 in) . The British agreed to the request , and the increased armour was ready by the time the tank was used in North Africa .

### Armament

The Matilda II was armed with a 2-pounder (40 mm (1.57 in)) gun . The gun was chosen because the British Army was not confident that the tank's armour could stop the more powerful 6-pounder (57 mm (2.24 in)) gun . The 2-pounder gun was not without its own problems . It was not powerful enough to penetrate the armour of German tanks and so the 6-pounder gun was used in the Matilda III .

The A13 Mk II was later developed with a 6-pounder 57 mm gun and a 2-pounder 40 mm gun . These vehicles were intended for use as infantry support vehicles , as the armour was not strong enough to withstand the German 37 mm anti-tank gun . The A13 Mk III was developed with an improved suspension and a 2-pounder 40 mm gun . The A13 Mk IV was developed with a 2-pounder 40 mm gun and a 6-pounder 57 mm gun .

## Design

The Tetrarch was a small armoured car with a crew of three . It was powered by a 220 hp (164 kW) Rolls-Royce B80 F-Type petrol engine that gave it a road speed of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a range of 120 miles (190 km) . It was armed with a 20 mm Oerlikon cannon and three .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns .

The Tetrarch's armour was 14 mm (0.55 in) thick . The Tetrarch was able to ford a stream 2 feet (0.61 m) deep .

The Tetrarch was also criticised for its small turret which was considered too small to accommodate a 3 inch (76.2 mm) gun , although this was also the case with the Crusader . A redesign of the Tetrarch to mount a 3 inch (76.2 mm) gun was considered but rejected .

## Operational history

The Tetrarch was originally planned to be used in the North African Campaign , with the British 7th Armoured Division . The first Tetrarchs were issued to the 4th Armoured Brigade in April 1941 . After the German invasion of the USSR in June 1941, the Tetrarch was used by the 1st Airborne Division , 1st Parachute Brigade and the 6th Airlanding Brigade , and in the Aegean campaign . In the North African Campaign the Tetrarchs were used to form the 2nd Armoured Brigade , later renamed the 2nd RTR , which was later reorganised as the 22nd Armoured Brigade . The Tetrarchs saw action in the Western Desert Campaign , Operation Crusader , the Battle of Gazala , Operation Torch , the Tunisian Campaign , the Sicilian Campaign and the Italian Campaign . 

The Tetrarch was used by the 1st Airborne Division during the Battle of Crete in 1941 . After the capture of Crete the Tetrarchs were returned to the United Kingdom and redeployed to the 1st Airborne Division in the United Kingdom . The Tetrarchs were also used during the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944 by the 2nd Parachute Brigade . The Tetrarchs were used by the 6th Airlanding Brigade in the Aegean campaign during 1941 .

> d to the Tetrarch , which was designed to enable the 2 pounder to fire the 6 pounder shell . This was found to be ineffective in combat as the 6 pounder shell was too heavy for the 2 pounder to fire and the gunner could not keep the tank steady enough to fire it , so the adaptor was abandoned . 

The Tetrarch was designed with a low profile to give it a low silhouette and thus reduce the chances of it being spotted by the enemy . The design of the Tetrarch was intended to make it as small as possible , with the turret and hull cast as one piece to reduce the number of joints . The turret was armoured with 20 mm of steel , while the hull had 16 mm . The design of the Tetrarch was a radical departure from previous British tanks , with the main armament in the turret and the engine and transmission in the hull . This was unusual at the time , with most British tanks having the engine and transmission in the hull and the main armament in the turret . 

The Tetrarch had a small crew of four , with the commander , gunner and driver sitting in the turret and the radio operator in the hull . The radio operator's position in the hull also made him vulnerable to fire from the enemy . 

The Tetrarch was also known as the Valentine Mark III . The Tetrarch was the first tank to be built in the United Kingdom to be fitted with a turret . 

## Design and development

The Tetrarch was designed in 1937 by the Vickers-Armstrongs company as a light tank . It was based on the design of the Vickers 6-Ton tank , which had been rejected by the British Army in 1936 . The Tetrarch was intended to be a cheap and light tank , and was intended to be used for reconnaissance . 

The Tetrarch was powered by a 214 hp engine , which gave the tank a top speed of 35 mph . The tank had a crew of four , with the driver and radio operator in the hull and the commander and gunner in the turret .

Set in the deserts of North Africa , the Tetrarchs served in the 2nd Armoured Brigade in support of the 7th Armoured Division .
In the early stages of the campaign , the Tetrarchs proved to be very effective in the desert environment due to their high speed and maneuverability . In November 1941 , during the Battle of Beda Fomm , the 2nd Armoured Brigade successfully used its Tetrarchs to destroy a force of 200 German tanks and 250 motorized vehicles that were attempting to encircle the 7th Armoured Division .
However , in the later stages of the campaign , the Tetrarchs were found to be less useful as they were vulnerable to the heavy machineguns and anti-tank guns used by the Axis forces . This was particularly true during the Battle of Gazala where the Tetrarchs were often destroyed by the German 88 mm anti-tank guns .
The Tetrarchs were also used in support of the British 8th Army during the Second Battle of El Alamein .
In early 1942 , the Tetrarchs were gradually replaced by the M3 Stuart and the M3 Grant , which were better suited to the desert environment . The last Tetrarchs were withdrawn from service in 1943 .
The Tetrarch was a light tank designed by Vickers-Armstrongs in the 1930s as a replacement for the Vickers 6-ton tank. It was originally designed as a cavalry tank , but was later adapted for infantry support. The Tetrarch was powered by a 140 hp (104 kW) petrol engine, which gave it a top speed of 40 mph (64 km/h). It had a crew of three and a main armament of a 2-pounder (40 mm) gun.
The Tetrarch was first used in combat in 1941 during the North African Campaign , where it was used by the British 7th Armoured Division . It was also used by the British 8th Army during the Second Battle of El Alamein .

The first 220 Tetrarchs were shipped to the USSR in 1941 , and were followed by 176 more in 1942 . The Tetrarchs were used in the defence of Stalingrad , and the Soviet armies used them as part of the offensive to break the Siege of Stalingrad .

The Tetrarchs were used in the offensives of the Red Army in 1942 and 1943 , and were used in the Battle of Kursk , and in the Battle of the Dnieper . They were used in the Battle of the Caucasus , and in the Battle of the Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive .

In 1943 , the 22nd Tank Division was formed in the USSR , and it was equipped with Tetrarchs .

The Soviets used the Tetrarchs in the battle for Moscow , where they were nicknamed the "sweets" by the Soviet soldiers . The Tetrarchs were also used in the Battle of Kursk , and in the Leningrad -Novgorod offensive , where they were called "British" tanks by the Soviet soldiers . In total , about 500 Tetrarchs were supplied to the USSR .
One of the Tetrarchs was captured by the Germans at the Battle of Kursk and was used by the Germans for testing . It was found that the tanks could not be repaired in the field and had to be towed back to Germany . The Tetrarch was then tested by the German military at the Zossen Proving Ground in Germany , where it was used as a target for anti-tank guns . The Tetrarch was given the designation Panzerkampfwagen 358(f) (Sd.Kfz. 140) by the Germans .
The Tetrarch was used in combat by the British in North Africa in the Tunisian Campaign .

The Tetrarch 's most serious flaw was its limited armament . While it had a 2-pounder gun , the tank was too lightly armoured to use the weapon effectively . The lack of a machine gun was also a serious flaw , and one which could not be rectified .

' C ' Squadron was the only unit to land on D-Day, and as the first British unit to land in France since Dunkirk, it was the first British unit to see combat on the European mainland since the Battle of France in 1940. ' C ' Squadron was to land on Juno Beach at Bernières-sur-Mer, while the rest of the brigade was to land on Gold Beach at Arromanches. The squadron was to land as part of the reserve forces, and was to land after the initial assaults had been made.
The squadron's advance to its objective, the town of Bernières-sur-Mer, was hampered by the presence of many mines on the beach and the presence of large numbers of German soldiers who had taken refuge in the town. The Germans were heavily outnumbered and had few anti-tank weapons with which to resist the advance of the British armour. The town was taken with little difficulty, although the squadron lost five vehicles and suffered 18 wounded, including the squadron commander, Lieutenant Colonel 'Jumbo' Jumbo-Grenville.
The squadron's advance continued to the village of Le Hamel, where it came under fire from the Germans who were dug in on the high ground above the village. The squadron was eventually able to capture the high ground, and the village itself was captured with little resistance.
The squadron then advanced to the village of Colleville-sur-Mer, where it was met by strong resistance from the Germans. The Germans had dug in on the high ground to the east of the village, and had set up machine guns to fire down on the village. The squadron was able to take the high ground, but was then forced to withdraw from the village after suffering heavy casualties.

 This caused a delay of over an hour and when the tanks finally did reach the shore, they found that the beach obstacles had been removed by the Royal Navy . This meant that they had to be driven through the sea defences and as a result, several tanks were damaged or destroyed . 

 Although the 43rd (Wessex) Division managed to capture its objectives by nightfall on 5 May , ' B ' Squadron was still struggling to get its tanks off the beach .

 The division was ordered to land at 07 : 00 on 6 June, but the naval bombardment of the area had failed to destroy the German defences and as a result, the lead landing craft were hit by German machine-gun fire and forced to return to the main fleet . The delay caused by the return of the landing craft resulted in the rest of the division landing after the initial objectives had been captured .

The Tetrarch is a light tank used by British and other armies during the Second World War. It was developed from the Vickers Light Tank Mk. VI. It was a successful design that saw service in many theatres of war.
The Tetrarch was designed in 1938 as an interim solution to the problem of the British Army's lack of light tanks. It was developed from the Vickers Light Tank Mk. VI, which was itself an improved version of the Vickers 6-Ton Light Tank. The Tetrarch had a crew of four, was armed with a 2-pounder (40 mm) gun, and was powered by a 164 hp (122 kW) engine. It had a top speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).
The Tetrarch was first used in combat during the Battle of France in 1940. It saw service with British and Commonwealth forces in the Second World War, and was used by the Free French in the North African Campaign. The Tetrarch was also used by the British 2nd Armoured Brigade in the Italian Campaign.
The Tetrarch was replaced in British service by the M3 Stuart light tank. It was also replaced by the M5 Stuart in the US Army.
The Tetrarch was produced in Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, France, Greece, and the United States.

The Tetrarch was a British light tank of the Second World War, first issued to British units in 1941. It was designed to replace the Mk VI, which had been the first British tank to have a diesel engine. The Tetrarch was produced by Vickers Armstrong in a limited number of 1,419 vehicles, with the Mk VI being replaced by the Crusader.
The Tetrarch was the first tank to be fitted with a diesel engine, which made it faster than previous British tanks. It was the only British tank to have a diesel engine in the Second World War, although some Soviet tanks were also fitted with diesel engines.
The Tetrarch was used by British forces in North Africa and Italy, and was also used by British forces in the Far East. It was not used by British forces in the European theatre of operations.

> on , Operation Tonga , did not take place until 1941 .

 Operation Tonga was a diversionary attack by the British 1st Airborne Division , carried out at the same time as the Allied invasion of Sicily , Operation Husky . The aim of Operation Tonga was to capture the bridges across the River Sangro in the Abruzzo region of Italy and so prevent the Italian 2nd Parachute Division from moving against the Allied beachheads . The operation was to be carried out by the 1st Parachute Brigade , which was to drop into the valley of the River Garigliano , capture the bridges over the river and destroy the German and Italian defences in the area . 

 The operation was intended to coincide with the main Allied invasion of Sicily , Operation Husky . The 1st Airborne Division , under command of Lieutenant General Richard Gale , was to capture the airfield at Ponte della Ghiaia , near Gela , to secure the left flank of the Allied beachhead and prevent the Italian 2nd Parachute Division from moving against the beachhead . The 1st Parachute Brigade was to capture the bridges over the River Sangro and destroy the German and Italian defences in the area .

 The operation was cancelled due to bad weather and later postponed because of the need to reinforce the beachheads at Gela and Reggio di Calabria .

 The Allied invasion of Sicily , Operation Husky , was launched on 10 July 1943 , with the initial landings at the south east tip of the island . The landings were preceded by an extensive air and naval bombardment of German and Italian positions in preparation for the assault . The assault was preceded by a diversionary attack on the beaches near Reggio di Calabria , Operation Ladbroke , by the 1st Airborne Division . The landings at the south east of the island were followed by a series of operations to clear the island of German and Italian forces . The Allies had already secured the airfields at Gela , Ponte dell'Olio and Ponte della Ghiaia by 13 July .

The 1st RTR were initially held back at the rear of the landing beaches , as a reserve force , but on the night of 10/11 November , they were ordered to move forward to the front . As they advanced , the Tetrarchs were subjected to heavy fire from German tanks , and one was destroyed by an 88 mm gun .

The Tetrarchs saw further action during the Second Battle of El Alamein , in November 1942 . During this battle , the 1st RTR were ordered to attack a heavily defended German strongpoint known as ' Box ' . As the Tetrarchs approached the German lines , they were subjected to heavy fire from 88 mm guns and artillery , and as a result , several were destroyed .

The 1st RTR continued to operate the Tetrarchs throughout 1943 , but they were not involved in any major operations during this period . In October 1943 , the division was sent to the Italian mainland , and the Tetrarchs were used to support the Allied advance across the Italian peninsula .

## History

### Discovery

Main article: Olmec head

Olmec figurine (2000-1000 BC), Louvre

In 1879, archaeologists discovered a number of colossal stone heads in the jungles of Veracruz and Tabasco, Mexico. These heads were so large that the Spanish explorers thought they were the heads of giants.

The first Olmec site to be discovered was San Lorenzo, which was excavated in the 1940s. The first Olmec site to be fully investigated was La Venta, which was excavated in the 1950s.

The name Olmec was given by ethnographer Manuel Gamio, based on the name of the town of Olmec, Veracruz. The Olmecs were the first people to develop a complex society in Mesoamerica. They were the first to develop a writing system, although it is not yet known how they used it. The Olmecs were the first to develop a system of long-distance trade, which involved the exchange of raw materials, such as obsidian, jade and salt.

### Olmec culture

The Olmecs were a people who inhabited the coastal lowlands of what is now the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Chiapas in Mexico, as well as the northern border areas of Guatemala and Belize. They are believed to have originated in the region of the modern-day Mexican state of Veracruz.

### Mesoamerican writing systems

Main article: Mesoamerican writing systems

The Maya script was used to write the languages of the Maya civilization. It is a syllabary, one of only three in the world (the others being the Brahmic family and the Arabic script), in which each symbol represents a consonant and vowel combination. The other Mesoamerican writing systems are the Zapotec and Mixtec scripts. The Maya script is one of the few writing systems that was still in use when the Spanish arrived in the 16th century.

The writing systems of Mesoamerica are quite different from the alphabets of Europe and Asia. The Mesoamerican writing systems are ideographic, syllabic, or logographic, and are written from right to left.

### The Olmecs

Main article: Olmecs

The Olmecs were an ancient Mesoamerican culture in what is now south central Mexico. The Olmecs flourished on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the lowlands of the modern-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Olmec artifacts have been found throughout Mesoamerica, and the Olmecs are referred to as "Mother Culture" of Mesoamerica because of their influence on later Mesoamerican cultures.

The Olmecs are generally credited with the invention of writing in Mesoamerica, although it is not known when they first developed a writing system. The earliest known example of Olmec writing is a set of glyphs on a monumental stele from the site of La Mojarra Stela 1. The monument dates to around 900 BC, and the glyphs on the stele are thought to represent the names of rulers, and their titles and achievements.

The Olmecs were a hierarchical society, and the rulers of the cities appear to have had a religious function.

I've been keeping an eye on the debate over the proposed Iraq War Memorial in Washington DC. I find the whole thing very disturbing, not only because it is so obviously the work of a bunch of political hacks, but because it seems to be a prime example of the kind of corrupt politics that the American people seem to love.
The debate is over the location of the memorial. The designers, a group of highly respected architects and artists, have proposed a memorial on the National Mall, near the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The site is near the Tidal Basin, where the cherry trees are blooming.
The proposed site is not perfect. There are several buildings in the area, and there is a busy highway nearby. But the site is a beautiful place, and it is a place that is already associated with memorials to the nation's heroes.
The memorial's opponents are led by the conservative Republican Senator from Virginia, James Webb. Webb is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War. He has claimed that the memorial's location is "inappropriate" because it is too close to the Tidal Basin.
This argument is nonsense. The site is already the location of several monuments. In addition, the proposed memorial would be in the same location as the memorial to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. That memorial is an elegant and beautiful structure. It is also in a park-like setting, not far from the Tidal Basin.
The real reason that Webb and his supporters oppose the memorial is that they don't like the design. They don't like the fact that the memorial is designed by a woman. They don't like the fact that it is designed by an Iraqi-American. They don't like the fact that

 The style of the colossal heads is generally regarded as having been influenced by the style of the early Maya . The heads are very naturalistic , with the faces being carefully modelled and the features being well defined . The large eyes are said to be characteristic of Olmec art , although the heads of the early Maya also display large eyes . The heads are large , with some weighing over 20 tons . The faces are usually carved with a serious expression , although a few show the mouths open in a smile . The style of the heads has been likened to that of African masks .


 The heads are often said to be the earliest examples of monumental sculpture in the Americas . The heads are associated with Olmec religion , with the most common interpretation being that they represent the Olmec deity Ehécatl , the wind god . Other interpretations include the idea that the heads represent the Olmec rulers .

 The colossal heads are the largest surviving examples of Olmec art , but they are not the only examples of monumental sculpture produced by the Olmecs .

The heads are remarkable for their size and the fact that they were carved from solid stone. They were cut from the living rock, using a technique known as "pecking", in which a series of shallow, narrow cuts were made to remove the stone. They are generally considered to be among the most outstanding examples of Maya art and engineering.
The San Lorenzo heads are located on the northern edge of the ancient city of San Lorenzo, on the southern slopes of the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes in the department of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. They were carved from the living rock at a site that is now within the boundaries of the Archaeological Park of San Lorenzo, which was established in 1962.
The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest , and are the most skillfully executed . All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology , generally to the Early Preclassic ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) , although the two Tres <unk> heads and the La <unk> Head are attributed to the Mature Preclassic ( 1000 BC – AD 250 ) .

 four colossal heads from La Venta were originally placed against a wall . All examples of Olmec colossal heads wear distinctive headdresses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals . Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head , and some are decorated with feathers . A head from La Venta is decorated with the head of a bird . There are similarities between the headdresses on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific headdresses may represent different dynasties , or perhaps identify specific individuals .

 Olmec stone sculpture is some of the earliest known sculpture of Mesoamerica , dating back to the earliest known Olmec sites . These sites were inhabited between 1400 and 400 BCE . The earliest examples of Olmec art are sculptures of colossal heads , which have been dated to around 1200 BCE . 

 The earliest known colossal head sculpture is the La Venta Colossal Head , which has been dated to between 1200 and 900 BCE . The La Venta Colossal Head was discovered in 1944 and is now displayed in the Museo de Antropología in Mexico City . It is carved from serpentinite and is 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) tall . The facial features of the sculpture are very stylised and have been interpreted by some as having a fanged mouth and having fangs . The eyes of the sculpture are also stylised , being represented as two circles . 

 Other colossal heads are known to have been sculpted from serpentinite , diorite and jadeite . Some of these are thought to have been carved from a single block of stone , whilst others are thought to have been carved from a number of smaller blocks . 

 The facial features of the sculptures are stylised and are thought to have been used as a system of communication . The facial expressions of the sculptures vary from stern through placid to smiling . Some of the heads have pierced ears .

 The Olmec heads were constructed with great care and attention to detail . They were carved from massive slabs of stone , with the front of the head and the shoulders formed from a single block . The back of the head and the neck were carved from a second block , which was joined to the first block at the top of the head . The face , eyes , nose , mouth and ears were carved separately , and then attached to the block . The Olmecs did not use metal tools or chisels , so the carving was done with stone chisels . The heads were then painted with red pigment , and decorated with jade and other stones . The Olmecs also carved the stone to represent jaguar teeth , which they wore as necklaces . The Olmec heads were carefully constructed , with each head having a distinctive face and body . They were placed in public places , where they could be seen by everyone .

The San Lorenzo Monument 1 and La Venta Monument 1 were both sculpted with the head of an anthropomorphic figure that is not a human but a hybrid of a human and jaguar . The Olmecs probably considered the jaguar as the most important of all animals . The La Venta Monument 1 figure has a rectangular shape and a slanting profile with a pointed chin . The head is set on a rectangular base with two protruding ears . The head has a large mouth with projecting teeth and a small round hole for an eye . The San Lorenzo Monument 1 head is much smaller with a flatter profile and a larger mouth . The head is set on a rectangular base with protruding ears and the mouth has a larger projecting tooth .

> ken . The most striking example of the Olmec style in the Gulf Coast region is the great colossal head of San Lorenzo . It is the largest sculpture in the Americas and one of the most remarkable works of art in the Western Hemisphere . It is also the only sculpture that can be unequivocally linked to the Olmec culture . The colossal head has been dated to the first century B. C . E .
The colossal head of San Lorenzo is 12 feet high and weighs an estimated 35 tons . It is made of compacted clay . The face is modeled in great detail and is remarkably realistic . The eyes are incised with a pair of parallel lines that extend into the nose and the mouth is a simple V-shaped cut . The ears are also incised and the cheeks are marked with a series of small indentations . The back of the head is flat and the sides are sloped . There is a vertical incision on the forehead , which may have been made to facilitate the transport of the monument . The back of the head is inset with three tiers of horizontal stripes , which may be the result of a later restoration . The face has been covered with a thin layer of white pigment , which has been partially eroded .
The colossal head of San Lorenzo is a masterpiece of Olmec art . It is one of the most important works of art in the Western Hemisphere and is a major symbol of the Olmec culture .
The Olmecs were a pre-Columbian culture that inhabited what is now Mexico and Guatemala . They were the first major civilization in Mesoamerica and were the precursors of the Maya and Aztec cultures .
The Olmecs were a sedentary agricultural society and they were known for their advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics . They also developed a complex system of writing and a sophisticated artistic style .
The Olmecs were the first people to develop a form of writing in Mesoamerica . Their writing system was based on symbols and glyphs that represented specific concepts or ideas . The Olmecs used their writing system to record information about their society and their religious beliefs .

 The majority of colossal heads are known from the tombs of Olmec elite . Many of these are found in the central part of the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . They were often placed in the tombs of elite individuals , sometimes in pairs . The most impressive example is the colossal head of La Venta , which was found in the tomb of the ruler of the city . This head was made from a single block of stone . The most famous pair of colossal heads is that of the 'Las Manos' monument at La Venta .

The head is unique, but the body and limbs are very similar to those of the Colossal Head of San Juan Teotihuacan, and the head of the Colossal Statue of the Sun from El Tajin.

The statue is made of volcanic rock with a grayish color and a fibrous texture. It measures 2.38 meters (7 ft 10 in) tall, and weighs 300 kg (660 lb). The statue is in a poor condition; its head has been broken off and is missing. It is now in the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico City.

 ' The discovery of Colossal Head 4 was the result of a series of unfortunate events that occurred during the 1946 archaeological season . The principal mound had been thoroughly excavated by Stirling , leaving only the southern part of the site to be explored . In the late afternoon of 23 April , Stirling and a group of workers were walking back to camp when they came upon the head . Stirling later recalled that he thought that it was the head of a statue , which had fallen and broken into several pieces . However , it soon became apparent that it was not a statue , but the head of a human being . He decided to bring it back to camp . The next morning , Stirling and some of the workers returned to the site to continue their excavations . They found the rest of the body , which was lying on its left side . This find was soon followed by the discovery of the burial chamber , which contained a large quantity of ceramic objects . The burial chamber was 3 metres ( 10 ft ) below the surface and contained a human skeleton , which had been placed in a sitting position in a pit . The skeleton was wrapped in a large piece of cloth , which had been tied to the arms . It is likely that the cloth had been used to carry the body . There was also a large amount of ceramic material , including a large number of vessels . The skeleton was in a good state of preservation , with only a few of the bones having been damaged . The skull was missing , but was later found lying on the floor of the burial chamber . The skeleton was later identified as belonging to a male individual , who had died in his early 20s .

Agriculture and the Mesoamerican calendar
Cerro Cintecal was a center of maize agriculture , and the site had a complex agricultural calendar system . The complex calendar system included a 260-day agricultural calendar , which was used to regulate agricultural labor and planting . The 260-day calendar was divided into 18 periods of 15 days each , and was augmented by a 360-day calendar that was used to regulate the changing seasons . The agricultural calendar was supported by a monumental complex of mounds and plazas , and included a 14-m-high (46 ft) "Moon Pyramid" that was aligned with the rising and setting of the moon .
The 260-day agricultural calendar was the first Mesoamerican calendar system to be recorded . The calendar was probably developed by the Olmecs , and was adopted by the Maya .
The agricultural calendar system was used in the Middle Preclassic Period , between 700 BC and 200 BC . The agricultural calendar was replaced by the 360-day calendar system in the Late Preclassic Period , between 200 BC and 200 AD .
Cerro Cintecal was a center of the Cintecal style of pottery , which was produced in the Middle Preclassic Period .

> as Monument 1 ) is located near the mouth of the San Andres River in the state of Veracruz , Mexico . The monument is a 16-foot (5 m) tall stone head that was carved from an ancient volcanic dike . It is believed to have been carved in the Early Classic period ( 300 - 600 CE ) , making it one of the oldest known stone monuments in Mesoamerica . It is the second largest of the Tres <unk> monuments and the largest known stone monument from the Olmec civilization .

## Discovery

The monument was discovered in 1918 by a local farmer who was clearing land near the San Andres River in the state of Veracruz. The farmer was using a pickaxe to break up the rocky ground when he came across the stone head. He immediately recognized that it was a monumental sculpture and notified the government of the discovery. It was then moved to the nearby town of Tres <unk> , where it was displayed in front of the town hall .

### Excavations

The monument was not excavated until 1938 , when Matthew Stirling of the Carnegie Institution of Washington conducted archaeological investigations at Tres <unk> . During his excavations , Stirling found the second monument ( Monument A ) and a number of other artifacts . These artifacts included a carved wooden mask , a ceramic vessel , and a small stone monument that was probably used as a burial marker .

 Volcano 2 ) is a volcano located in the Chicxulub crater in the Yucatán Peninsula , Mexico . The volcano was active approximately 65 million years ago , forming the Chicxulub impact structure and ejecting a layer of tephra . The volcano is named after the nearby town of Chicxulub . The Chicxulub impact event has been linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs . Geology The Chicxulub impact crater is a 180 kilometres ( 110 mi ) diameter impact structure in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico . The impact occurred approximately 65 million years ago , and is the only confirmed case of a large asteroid impact on Earth in the last 500 million years . The impact structure was formed when a 10 to 15 kilometres ( 6 to 9 mi ) diameter asteroid struck the Earth . The impact is thought to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , which is thought to have contributed to the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs . The impact structure was discovered in 1991 by American scientists . The name of the impact structure is derived from the nearby town of Chicxulub . The Chicxulub impact structure is one of the most recent of several impact craters in the Yucatán Peninsula . The other impact structures in the region are the Acanceh impact structure , the Chicxulub North impact structure and the Copper Canyon impact structure . The Chicxulub impact structure is unusual in that it has an unusually low density of impact craters . The crater is relatively shallow in comparison to other impact craters , with a maximum depth of 3.5 kilometres ( 2.2 mi ) . The Chicxulub crater is known as a multi-ring structure , meaning that the crater is surrounded by a series of concentric craters . The Chicxulub impact crater is the only confirmed case of a multi-

 No other Olmec sculptures with closed eyes have been found .
The monument has been suggested as an example of Olmec iconography , in particular the concept of the "Otherworld" . This concept is found in a number of Olmec artifacts and was used by Olmec people to explain natural phenomena . The concept is also found in the Maya , Aztec and other Mesoamerican cultures . The Otherworld was a place where the dead were taken , where the gods lived and where the sun was created .
The Olmecs used a number of ways to explain the Otherworld and the concept is found in many Olmec artifacts . The monument may have been used to explain the creation of the sun and the myth of the creation of the universe . It is possible that the monument may have been used to explain the creation of the sun , since it is located at the base of the pyramid .
The monument has been the subject of speculation about the use of psychotropic substances , such as peyote .
The monument is now in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City .

### The Lairig

The Lairig is a path that runs along the northern side of Lochaber and Ardnamurchan, from Fort William to the end of the road at the hamlet of Kilchoan. It was created in the 19th century as a pathway for the drovers who drove their cattle from the lowlands to the markets of the west coast . The name "Lairig" is Gaelic for "pass", and the path was originally known as the Pass of Glen Kingie .

The Lairig runs from the head of Loch Linnhe to the Sound of Mull, passing through Glen Kingie, Glen Feshie and Glen Shiel . The route is marked by a series of stone cairns and waymarks, and the path is described in the book The Drovers' Road by George Chalmers . The route is also described by Kenneth Macleod in his book Travels in the Western Highlands .

### The Lairig Fhionn Loch

The Lairig Fhionn Loch is a pass in the north-west of the Isle of Skye that links Loch Dunvegan with Loch na Cuileag . The pass was used in pre-Christian times to take cattle to the markets of Skye , and was later used by drovers to drive cattle to the markets of Inverness and Glasgow .

The Lairig Fhionn Loch is located on the north-western side of the island, and runs from the head of Loch Dunvegan to the head of Loch na Cuileag . The pass is located on the watershed between the catchments of the rivers Abhainn na Caillich and Abhainn na h-Iolaire . The pass is located at an elevation of 460 metres (1,510 ft) and is approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) in length .

**S** tevens's first day in the Navy was June 16, 1999. He reported to the Naval Training Center in Great Lakes, Illinois, a sprawling complex of brick and concrete buildings on the shore of Lake Michigan. The center had been built during the Great Depression to house and train thousands of recruits for the Second World War. By the time Stevens arrived, it had been expanded to accommodate tens of thousands of sailors, soldiers, and airmen every year. The center's population was so large that the Navy considered it a city.
Stevens was assigned to a company of recruits known as "White Jackets." This was the first step in a rigorous four-month process that would make him a seaman recruit, or SR. White Jackets was a training company that took recruits through basic military training. Stevens was assigned to a platoon of thirty-two recruits. The platoon was led by a chief petty officer named Joe Chapman. Chapman had been in the Navy for twenty-five years and had seen recruits through White Jackets for more than a decade. He was a big, powerful man with a broad, expressive face and a head of graying hair. He was gruff and tough, and he was known to have a temper. He had been an alcoholic in the past, but he had been sober for several years.
Chapman was a by-the-book drill instructor. He was committed to making his recruits the best sailors they could be. He told them they would go through hell in the next four months, but he was confident they would be able to handle it. He was always on time, always in uniform, and always ready to give orders. He did not tolerate any kind of disobedience or disrespect from his recruits.
Chapman's company was a large one. There were several other platoons of recruits in the company, each led by a different drill instructor. The company was divided into two squadrons. One squadron was composed of recruits who were going to become aviation mechanics, and the other squadron was composed of recruits who were going to become mach

### Offense

Stevens has made a name for himself as one of the top offensive minds in the NBA , and is considered one of the best coaches in the league at drawing up plays .

Stevens is known for his unorthodox play calls , including the " Hack-a-Shaq " strategy in which he instructs his players to foul Shaquille O'Neal heavily in the fourth quarter in order to prevent him from scoring . Stevens said of the strategy: " We were getting our butts kicked by Shaq . We were down 20 with 12 minutes to go and I said, ' We're not getting this guy the ball . We're going to foul him. ' " The Celtics have continued to use this strategy, and have continued to win.

### Defense

In addition to being an offensive wizard , Stevens has become one of the best defensive coaches in the NBA. He is known for his ability to disguise defenses , using the same principles of deception and misdirection that he used in his days as a poker player .

Stevens is known for using the " matchup zone " defense , in which players switch defensive assignments frequently in order to confuse offensive players . This defense has become a trademark of Stevens' Celtics teams , and opponents have often had trouble adjusting to it.

### Personality

Stevens has a calm and collected personality that has helped him to become one of the most respected coaches in the NBA . He is known for being a team player who is always willing to help his players improve , and is often praised for his ability to build strong relationships with his players .

Stevens is also known for being a tough and demanding coach who holds his players to high standards . He is not afraid to bench players if they are not performing up to his expectations , and has been known to call out his players publicly if they are not playing up to their potential .

> s team is not shooting the ball well , but they 're not the worst shooting team in the country " . After 10 games , Butler was 21st in the nation in field goal percentage (48.6%) and 31st in three-point percentage (39.5%) . Stevens had used statistics to show his players they could shoot better . 

 Stevens has also been known to employ " crazy statistics " , which he describes as " some of the most obscure statistics you 've ever heard of " . In a 2008 interview with The Wall Street Journal , he said he had " never seen a game where a team had more shots blocked than their opponent " . Stevens believed that his team had the ability to block more shots than their opponent and he wanted his players to " think outside the box " and realize their ability to block more shots . 

 Stevens is a proponent of using statistics to enhance his coaching decisions , spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film . " I think it 's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players " , he explains . For example , when Butler was slumping in late 2010 , Stevens challenged his team : " this team is not shooting the ball well , but they 're not the worst shooting team in the country " . After 10 games , Butler was 21st in the nation in field goal percentage (48.6%) and 31st in three-point percentage (39.5%) . Stevens had used statistics to show his players they could shoot better . 

 Stevens has also been known to employ " crazy statistics " , which he describes as " some of the most obscure statistics you 've ever heard of " . In a 2008 interview with The Wall Street Journal , he said he had " never seen a game where a team had more shots blocked than their opponent " . Stevens believed that his team had the ability to block more shots than their opponent and he wanted his players to " think outside the box " and realize their ability to block more shots . 

 Stevens is a proponent of using statistics to enhance his coaching decisions , spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film . " I think it 's a unique way of

The Shackleton crater is one of the few lunar regions which is likely to contain ice . 

 The presence of water ice is attractive to future lunar exploration missions , as it could be used as a resource for the production of rocket fuel and life support . 

 The existence of ice at the poles was confirmed by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft , which also detected the presence of hydrogen in the regolith .

In 1973, teenage Lester Ballard (Bill Paxton) discovers a woman's dead body in a remote area of Tennessee.

In this chapter I focus on American Beauty , noting that its critical success and its subsequent influence on other filmmakers and audiences has been largely due to its evocation of a particular time and place (the suburbs of 1990s America) and to its representation of that time and place. The film's evocation of the 1990s is more than just a background for its narrative, however. As in other American films of the 1990s, the film's 1990s setting serves as a kind of time capsule, a moment in history which can be looked back upon and interpreted as a way of understanding the present. The film's representation of the 1990s as a particular time and place is thus also a representation of the present. In this chapter I explore the ways in which the film represents and interprets the 1990s, and how its 1990s time capsule is also a representation of the present.
The film's 1990s setting is established in the film's first scene, which opens on the family home of the film's protagonist, Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacey ). Lester's wife, Carolyn ( Annette Bening ), is a busy and successful realtor, and their home is a well-maintained but empty-feeling suburban home. Lester and Carolyn's teenage daughter, Jane ( Thora Birch ), is a popular and attractive girl, but she seems uninterested in her looks and has little interest in boys. Lester's job as a window cleaner is the only source of income in the household, and Carolyn makes all the decisions. Lester is an unhappy man, and the film's opening scene establishes the malaise of the film's characters.
The film's first sequence is a long tracking shot through the Burnham home, which reveals the family's everyday life. The shot begins in the living room and travels through the kitchen, bathroom, and upstairs bedrooms. The camera then leaves the house and travels along the street to Lester's workplace, a window cleaning business. The camera continues its journey through the

The rose is also used in the film's " most memorable visual motif " , the " red rose-covered house " that Lester sees in his dreams , which represents " Lester 's fantasy of the perfect family " and is symbolic of his " sublimated desire for a family " . 

 The film's title refers to a Lester Burnham speech in which he describes the beauty of American suburbia and how it is fading away. In the scene, he describes how he used to have a " red convertible " and how he used to be " free " . The film's title also refers to a type of flower , the American Beauty rose , which is a symbol of Lester's transformation , his fantasy of a perfect family , and his unrequited love for Carolyn . 

 The film's score is composed by Thomas Newman . " The theme is based on a chord progression that is repeated throughout the movie and is a subtle way of drawing the audience into the emotional undercurrents of the film " , Newman said . " The use of the same progression in the soundtrack 's score is a subtle way of keeping the audience connected to the film , so that they are aware of the emotional undercurrents that are constantly shifting " . In addition to the score , the film also features the songs " Unforgiven " by Metallica and " Life During Wartime " by Talking Heads , both of which are heard in scenes that are played backward .

> uffled feathers in the early 2000s " . Pennington argues that " the film is actually a critique of masculinity itself, which has become a performance " .

### Homosexuality

The film's focus on the relationship between Lester Burnham and Jim, as well as the scenes where Lester watches his son, Chris, with his friends, have been interpreted as an exploration of homosexuality. Lester's affair with Jim is described as an example of the "male gaze", the "patriarchal male's perception of the female body". According to the New York Times, the film's "revealing, unashamed scenes of male nudity", as well as the scenes in which Lester watches Chris, are "so saturated with homoerotic overtones that they suggest a subtext of homosexuality".

### Class

The film's portrayal of the Burnham family has been described as a "class-conscious film" that shows the "lives of a working-class family in a white, middle-class, suburban, small-town America". The family's class status has been interpreted as the cause of the family's problems.

### The American Dream

The film has been described as "a darkly comic deconstruction of the American Dream" in which "the main characters all search for happiness, but only find it in the most bizarre and horrifying ways". The film's portrayal of the American Dream has been compared to the films of David Lynch and the works of Bret Easton Ellis.

### Beauty

The film has been described as "a meditation on the nature of beauty", with the film's characters attempting to find "beauty in the most unexpected places". The film's exploration of beauty has been compared to the works of John Waters.

### Masculinity

The film's portrayal of masculinity has been described as a "deconstruction of American masculinity" in which "men are shown as weak and pathetic creatures" and "their only strength is in their ability to take advantage of women". The film's portrayal of masculinity has been compared to the works of David Lynch.

 che , on the other hand , presents a much more " mature " , " authentic " masculinity than does Lester . che 's adoption of an " alternative " model of masculinity , as he travels through the different parts of his life , is presented as an " act of resistance " against the " traditional " model . His " refusal " to adhere to the " norms " of masculinity is one that is " self-determined , self-initiated , and self-directed " . che 's " commitment " to this " alternative " masculinity is made clear by the fact that he " survives " and " triumphs " over his problems , and is able to " reinvent himself " as a " new man " .

> is a shot of Lester standing on the lawn and looking at the sky , followed by a shot of the Burnhams ' house . The second shot is from the same position and angle as the first , but the family is no longer visible . This repetition is enhanced by the fact that Lester 's behaviour is largely predictable , and that the film is very much concerned with the quotidian aspects of his life . This is reflected in the fact that the film is often shot in long takes and that Lester 's actions are not always accompanied by dialogue . For example , Lester walks into the kitchen to find his wife standing by the stove , and the camera tracks him as he moves towards her . She turns to face him , and the camera stays with her , allowing us to see the look of shock on her face as he stands over her . The absence of dialogue makes this sequence particularly effective . The film is also notable for its lack of music . It is only in the final scene that the soundtrack includes an original song by Lester . <unk> argues that this is significant because it shows that the film is not " a musical " in the traditional sense . Rather , it is an " aural narrative " in which " sound is a crucial element " . This is because music is used to emphasise the " ambiguity and the ambiguity of the characters " . The film is also notable for its use of " diegetic sound " , which allows the audience to hear what the characters are hearing . This gives a sense of " reality " to the film , and enhances the feeling of " detachment " that is a key feature of the film . The film was made on a low budget , and this is reflected in the fact that the majority of shots are handheld . This adds to the feeling of " realism " and helps to create the " claustrophobic " atmosphere that is a key feature of the film . <unk> argues that the film is " an exercise in style " , and that its " repetitive structure " is " a hallmark of the film " . He also argues that the film is " a masterclass in the use of sound " , and that the " diegetic sound " is " an integral part of the film 's aural design " . <unk> argues that the film is " an aural narrative " , and that its use of " dieget

The diegesis is further disturbed by the use of cross-cutting between the gym scene and a flashback sequence in which a young Lester is shown watching Angela perform on a stage in the school auditorium .
. The soundtrack, which is one of the most prominent elements of the film, is also used to create a tension between the diegesis and the subjective viewpoint of the protagonist . The diegesis is frequently interrupted by Lester 's subjective fantasies and memories . As a result, the film creates a fragmented and disjointed narrative that is difficult to follow . This is in keeping with the theme of the film — the fragmentation of Lester 's mind and the collapse of the diegesis .

 final draft .
During the development of the screenplay , Ball rewrote and expanded the original story , which took place in a suburban neighborhood in the Los Angeles area , to a rural setting in the fictional suburb of West Roseburg , Ohio . He also expanded the film 's cast , which originally included only Lester Burnham 's family , to include characters such as the Burnhams ' neighbors and schoolmates , who would be directly affected by Lester 's actions .
In June 1998 , DreamWorks acquired the rights to the screenplay . The studio had originally planned to produce the film as a live-action feature , but eventually decided to make it a 3D animated film . At that time , Ball was unable to find a director who would be willing to work on the project . He then approached Sam Mendes , who had directed the 1998 film American Beauty , to direct the film . Mendes agreed to direct the film on the condition that the studio would hire Ball to rewrite the screenplay .
The film 's score was composed by Thomas Newman . Newman, who had previously worked with Mendes on American Beauty , was recommended to Mendes by his friend, composer Danny Elfman .
In October 2010 , a short film titled American Beauty: The Original Short Film was released on iTunes . The film was originally part of the screenplay 's first draft , but was removed by Ball because he felt it did not fit the narrative . The short film was directed by Newman and produced by DreamWorks Animation .
American Beauty was released on December 16, 1999 , by DreamWorks Pictures . The film was distributed theatrically by Paramount Pictures , which had previously distributed American Beauty .
American Beauty was a critical and commercial success . The film grossed $356 million worldwide and was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1999 . It received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture , and won the Academy Award for Best Director .

 Ball initially considered having Kevin Spacey , who had starred in The Ref and Swimming with Sharks , play the role of Lester Burnham , but was persuaded to choose Spacey's longtime friend and collaborator, Kevin Costner . The casting of Annette Bening was considered a coup for DreamWorks , as she was an actress with a high-profile reputation who was currently in demand . Spacey and Bening's casting was considered a coup by the film industry . 

 Ball was not initially happy with the casting of Mena Suvari as Angela , stating that he wanted a blonde actress . He was eventually persuaded to give Suvari the role after meeting her . 

### Filming

The film was shot in several locations around the Bay Area , including Piedmont and San Francisco . The house in which Lester and his family live was built on the campus of the College of Marin in Kentfield , California . 

The film was shot on 35mm film , with a digital intermediate used to enhance the visuals .

DreamWorks , which was then a year away from opening its own studio , was not yet in a position to produce a film on its own . The company was still in the process of signing a deal with Paramount Pictures , and was also in negotiations with Universal Studios . DreamWorks president and co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg had been trying to persuade Ball to develop a film with the studio for some time , but Ball was hesitant because DreamWorks had never made a film before . Eventually, Ball agreed to write the screenplay for DreamWorks , which would produce the film with Paramount .
In December 1998 , Ball was officially hired to write the screenplay , with a $1.5 million salary . He began work on the script in January 1999 . He wrote two drafts in a matter of weeks, and was then hired to rewrite the script for a third time. He received a $1 million fee for the third draft.
During the writing process, Ball had to deal with the constant interference from the studio. He had to fight to keep the project true to the original story. Ball stated that "it was so frustrating at times to be in a room with these executives who were all telling me what they thought was right, and what I thought was wrong ." The executives did not understand the film's darker themes and wanted the film to be more "accessible" for a mainstream audience. DreamWorks was also concerned about the film's length, which was 182 minutes long when Ball completed the third draft. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Ball stated that "the studio kept telling me, 'You're gonna lose 40 minutes of your film.' And I said, 'I'm not gonna lose a frame of it.'" Ball's final draft was 191 minutes long. DreamWorks executives decided to bring in another screenwriter, John Logan , to rewrite the script. Ball was unhappy with the decision, stating that he felt the film was already "perfect."
The studio also wanted to change the ending of the film. Ball said that "the studio wanted to do a Hollywood ending where Ida [ the mother ] and the son would make up, and they would live happily ever after ." However, Ball refused to

After meeting with over a dozen directors , Ball selected Greg Mottola . Mottola was a relatively unknown director at the time , having only directed a few short films and television episodes .

The Truman Show 's director Peter Weir , who had met Mendes at a film festival in Venice , felt that Mendes was " the best director of the next generation " . Weir was also impressed by the film 's use of an unreliable narrator . He felt that Mendes " took the whole idea of the unreliable narrator and pushed it to the limit " . He was also impressed by the film 's use of a deadpan style , which he felt Mendes had inherited from the Coen brothers . He also felt that the film was a " great comedy " .

Geffen had been impressed by Mendes ' work on The End of the Affair , and told Spielberg that Mendes would be a good fit for the adaptation of the novel The Ghost Writer . The studio began a process of courtship of Mendes , sending him a letter of intent in August 1998 . The letter included a seven page treatment , which was written by DreamWorks ' development executive , Karen Lunder . Mendes ' response was that he would not begin working on the adaptation until he had read the book . After reading the book , Mendes began work on the script . Mendes , Lunder , and DreamWorks ' head of development , David Matalon , were the only ones to see the first draft of the script . Mendes ' first draft was 120 pages long , and the studio was not impressed . DreamWorks ' head of production , Stacey Sher , told Mendes to go back and rework the script . Mendes spent a month rewriting the script , which was now 140 pages long . The studio liked the new script , but they wanted Mendes to make it a little longer . Mendes , who was then working on the script for The Road to Perdition , told DreamWorks that he did not want to make the script any longer .

Monahan read the script and told the studio that the script had a lot of problems , but that Mendes could fix them . DreamWorks ' development executive , Bruce Berman , told Monahan that he would call Mendes and Monahan to discuss the script . The studio asked Monahan to read the book , which he did . Monahan told the studio that the book was better than the script , and that the script did not do justice to the book . After reading the book , Monahan told Mendes to write a new script .

 Ball later said that he had not intended to write a film about the Amy Fisher case , but had instead used it as a springboard to explore a larger theme . The resulting script , entitled " Drunken Angel " , was a " black comedy about a young woman who becomes famous for a very stupid reason" . The script attracted the attention of producer Cary Woods , who told Ball that he would produce the film if Ball would change the script's setting to a different country .

Ball also decided to change the character of Sergeant Pepper from a man to a woman . Ball said that the switch was made for several reasons : " It was a chance to give a woman a major role in a film , to show that women could do things that were traditionally done by men , and to say that there's no such thing as a typical woman ." 17 Ball's choice of actor was Carol Kane , who had recently appeared in Taxi Driver (1976). Kane was the only major actor not to audition for the role of Sergeant Pepper . Kane had originally been cast as a major character in The Sentinel (1977), but dropped out of the production because of scheduling conflicts . Ball offered her the part in Stripes after meeting her on the set of Taxi Driver . Ball said that Kane was " a very brave person . She was willing to do something that she had never done before ." 18 The scene in which Sergeant Pepper tries to seduce John Winger was added to the script after Ball read an article about a woman who had tried to pick up soldiers at a military base . Ball said, " It just seemed like such a brilliant idea ." 19

### Reception

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 96% of 151 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 9.0 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, "A darkly comic look at suburban life, American Beauty is a shocking and occasionally brilliant film." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, calling it "a film that will stand out as one of the great ones of our time." He later ranked it as the third best film of the 21st century. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film four out of four stars, saying, "American Beauty is one of the best movies of the year, maybe the decade, maybe even the century. I can't believe it was written and directed by a 30-year-old named Sam Mendes. American Beauty is a movie of astonishing intelligence, emotional complexity, and technical mastery. It's a film that will stand the test of time."

Entertainment Weekly ranked the film #2 on its "50 Best High School Movies" list, writing that "The film may be set in the suburbs, but the story of a family's dysfunction is universal. The kids are bored and disaffected, the parents are miserable, and the whole thing's just a matter of time before it blows up. Throw in a pretty good soundtrack, and you've got a movie that's truly beautiful."

In 2007, Entertainment Weekly ranked it #28 on their "100 Greatest Movies of All Time" list.

James Berardinelli wrote, "American Beauty is an excellent movie that is not to be missed. It is a remarkably well-crafted motion picture, both in its acting and in its direction." In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote, "This is a movie about the unreality of the American dream, and about how, in this time of increasing materialism, people are more and more obsessed with acquiring things and projecting the image of having them. In a way, it's a very old-fashioned movie, but one with a contemporary twist." In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert wrote, "American Beauty is a brilliant film, and I mean brilliant in the same way that a great work of art is brilliant. It's not the usual kind of brilliant. It's not brilliant because

> iring a stuntman for the scene was not an option , as he felt he could not trust someone else to perform the action . Mendes thought of the scene as a ballet , and used a handheld camera to capture the movements of the bag . He had the bag weighted and attached to a harness to allow the bag to be thrown and twirled through the air . Mendes practiced the scene with the bag for three days , and performed it himself during the filming .

The scene was shot in one take , as Mendes was concerned with the bag not coming back to him . The take lasted for 10 seconds , and was shot on 35 mm film , which is the largest format used for cinematography . The bag was made of paper , with the weight added to it for it to be thrown in the air . Mendes used the camera on a tripod , and used a telephoto lens .

"It's one of the most graceful things I've ever seen. I wanted to see if I could do it, and I did. It was my first time doing it, and I think I did it pretty well. It was just one take. The whole thing was done in one take. I had to do it over and over again until I got it right. I'm not sure if I'm a great director or not, but I'm pretty sure I'm a good director.

It serves as the transition to Lester 's journey to the Burnhams ' home , the narrative event which precipitates the crisis in Lester's life . The truck is presented in a shot-reverse shot structure with Angela and Lester . In the reverse shot , Angela and Lester are shown from behind in an extreme long shot . Hall used a camera crane to establish the long shot . The camera was placed on the crane , and the crane was moved over the actors to create the reverse shot .

Lester , an ordinary man , is placed in a situation that forces him to take action .

American Beauty 

## Plot

The film focuses on Lester Burnham, a middle-aged, disgruntled husband and father who has a midlife crisis while working as a real estate agent and struggling to maintain a marriage with his wife, Carolyn, and relationship with his teenage daughter, Jane. Lester is also in a sexless, loveless relationship with his wife, and is attracted to his teenage daughter's friend, Angela Hayes, a high school cheerleader. Lester is discontented with his life and contemplates suicide, but changes his mind after seeing Angela in a beauty pageant.

The story is told primarily through Lester's internal monologue, which consists of reminiscences of his past and his dreams of a better future. Lester's life is thrown into turmoil when he has a car accident and his marriage becomes more strained. Meanwhile, his daughter Jane's life is in turmoil as she faces bullying at school and her parents' divorce. Jane's father, Bud, a high school football coach, is a bigot and a misogynist who abuses his wife and his daughter, who is attracted to her schoolmate Ricky Fitts, who is also a victim of Bud's abuse.

Lester becomes close with Angela and her family. Angela's father, Col. Frank Fitts, is a retired military officer who is obsessed with Angela's beauty and who, in the film's most controversial scene, forces Lester to watch him masturbate in his car. Frank has a brief affair with Jane's friend, Jared, and is later arrested for molesting his own daughter, Angela's sister, Gretchen.

As the film progresses, Lester is increasingly estranged from his wife and daughter, but becomes closer to Angela and her family. After the divorce, Lester and Jane move in with Carolyn's sister and her husband. Lester attempts suicide by lying in front of an oncoming car, but is stopped by Angela. Afterwards, he and Angela begin an affair.

Lester becomes jealous of Angela's relationship with Ricky, who is a photographer. Ricky takes a picture of Angela that L

In The Washington Post, Ann Hornaday called the film a "lively and provocative comedy" and said, "The Kids Are All Right is a master class in how to make a movie that is both funny and poignant, a film that delivers on its title's promise while never resorting to the sort of schmaltz that makes us squirm.

Galba (left) and Otho (right)

Nero was adopted by his great-uncle Claudius , who was the nephew of Augustus . Nero's adoption was probably arranged by his mother Agrippina the Elder , who married Claudius in 49. Claudius had no children, so by adopting Nero he ensured that Nero would be his heir. Nero was the fifth Roman emperor and the last member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty . He was known as a tyrannical ruler and has been infamously remembered in history.

After Claudius' death in 54, Nero's mother, Agrippina, made sure that Nero would succeed to the throne. She had her lover, Lucius Junius Silanus , murdered by poisoning his food. Then she had her brother, Marcus Junius Silanus , murdered. She then had her third husband, Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus , murdered. She then forced Claudius' freedman, Narcissus , to murder Claudius' son, Britannicus , by poisoning his food. Nero was then forced to marry Claudius' daughter, Octavia.

### Inscriptions

In 170 AD , a marble inscription was discovered in Rome which contained the words "to the Christians who were imprisoned and persecuted by the proconsul of Asia , Sergius Paulus , for the name of Christ , and who were finally set free from their bonds under the Emperor Vespasian ," with the year 125 AD inscribed in the margin. The inscription is considered to be a memorial to the persecution of Christians during the reign of Nero.

### Tacitus

The Annals by Tacitus is the main source for the persecution of Christians under Nero. Tacitus reports that Nero was blamed for the fire in Rome in 64 AD and that he attempted to deflect the blame on the Christians. He reports that Nero's advisors suggested to him that he "punish with the utmost severity the originators of the rumour, and at the same time put a stop to all talk by inflicting a severe penalty on those who were caught in the act". He reports that Nero complied with this advice and ordered that the Christians be executed. Tacitus reports that the persecution of Christians continued for a short time after Nero's death in 68 AD.

### Suetonius

The Life of Nero by Suetonius is a source for the persecution of Christians under Nero. Suetonius reports that Nero "condemned to death those who confessed and those who denied it, and to punishment, both for the Christians and the Jews, those who were seized at the time of the fire, and those who were arrested on the accusation of having seized on the occasion of the fire, and those who were denounced by their confederates."

### Cassius Dio

The Roman History by Cassius Dio is a source for the persecution of Christians under Nero. Dio reports that Nero had Christians arrested and executed for the fire in Rome and that Nero himself was responsible for the death of his mother.

The early part of his reign was marked by a series of scandals , ranging from the discovery of the Pisonian conspiracy to the burning of Rome , the murder of his mother , and the death of his tutor , Seneca.
The sources of his troubles came from his own mismanagement and from the distrust of the Praetorian Guard . The latter led to the murder of his mother , which left him without a political mentor and left him with an increasingly erratic personality . This led to the death of his wife , Octavia , and to his exile of his former tutor , Seneca . He was also criticised for his extramarital affairs and for the death of his wife , Poppaea , who was killed during childbirth .
In 68 , he was accused of starting the Great Fire of Rome , which led to the death of his prefect of the Praetorian Guard , Gaius Ofonius Tigellinus . After he managed to survive the conspiracy of Piso , he began to execute members of the Roman aristocracy . He also persecuted Christians , ordering the execution of the Apostle Paul . In 69 , he was forced to abdicate and committed suicide on 9 June 69 .
Apart from the Great Fire of Rome , Nero 's other main legacy was his promotion of the arts . He also had a major influence on the Roman music , which was the predecessor of modern Western music . The Neronia were games and public spectacles that were staged in his honour during his reign .

However , Tacitus says that Poppaea's divorce from Otho was not final until 62 and that the divorce was for political reasons . Nero himself is quoted as saying that he had to wait until his mother was dead before he could marry Poppaea .

## Other theories

Another possibility is that Agrippina was murdered by her son because of his growing paranoia . Tacitus says that Nero was paranoid and had been since the early days of his reign . Suetonius says that Nero's paranoia was so great that he feared being poisoned by his own cooks and even his wife .

Another theory is that Agrippina was murdered in order to prevent her from interfering in Nero's administration . Nero's rule was increasingly unpopular among the Roman aristocracy and the senate . Nero's increasingly brutal treatment of the senate and his increasingly unpopular policies such as the persecution of the Christians and the burning of Rome in 64 AD were also disliked by Agrippina . Suetonius says that Agrippina disapproved of Nero's execution of his mother's friend and former slave Epicharis . Suetonius also says that Agrippina was a firm believer in the Roman tradition of patrician rule and was a great admirer of her father Germanicus . Nero's increasingly tyrannical rule was incompatible with this traditional Roman ideal and Agrippina disapproved .

The assassination attempt was discovered and Nero 's mother Agrippina the Younger was forced to leave Rome . The following year , in 63 , the general Gaius Julius Vindex , the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis (modern-day France) , led a revolt against the emperor in Gaul . The revolt was sparked by news of Galba 's attempted assassination . 

 The rebellion was supported by the Roman army in Germany under the leadership of Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus . Nero 's general in Gaul , Gaius Suetonius Paulinus , led the Roman legions in defeating the rebellion . Nero 's forces defeated the rebels at the Battle of Vesontio (modern-day Besançon ) . The revolt ended with the suicide of Vindex and the death of Silanus . In 65 , Nero survived another conspiracy by the senator Galerius Lucanus . Lucanus was a member of the Senate and was also the governor of Asia . The conspiracy was discovered when Lucanus was found with a note in his possession that was written by Nero . The note instructed Lucanus to kill Nero and proclaim the Senate leader, Servius Cornelius Dolabella , as the new emperor . 

 Lucanus was executed for treason , while Dolabella was forced to commit suicide by Nero . The following year , in 66 , Nero survived a conspiracy led by his praetorian prefect , Gaius Ofonius Tigellinus . Tigellinus and his co-conspirators planned to kill Nero and replace him with Nero 's mother , Agrippina the Younger .

Historians differ on Nero 's motive for suicide . Suetonius , for instance , says that he was disconsolate over the loss of his kingdom and was saddened by the deaths of those who had died in the revolts , but most modern historians believe that he simply did not want to live without his kingdom . 

### Aftermath

Nero 's death was the signal for the Senate to declare the revolt a rebellion against the Empire . After Nero 's death , the Roman army was recalled to Rome from Britain , and the army in Germania was ordered to march against the rebels , but both of these armies refused to fight , so the Senate had to make peace with the rebels . Vespasian , the commander of the Germanic army , was given the task of putting down the rebellion in Gaul and Germania . In Gaul , he managed to defeat the rebels , but in Germania , he was defeated and forced to retreat , leaving the rebels in control of Germany .

### Flavius Sabinus

The only Flavian emperor to not have his own reign name , Sabinus reigned for only one day in 69 , after his uncle Gaius Caligula and before his father Vespasian .

 His reign was brief , but it was also unique in that it was a return to the days of the Republic , with Sabinus himself being a consul and a tribune of the people . 

 It is also notable that Sabinus was the last of the Julio-Claudian emperors to be appointed to the consulship . 

 Sabinus ' reign was the first time since the days of the Republic that a plebeian had been appointed to the consulship . 

 In his short time in office , Sabinus took the opportunity to make a number of reforms and to start the process of transferring power from the Senate to the emperor . 

 Sabinus is also known to have abolished the office of the pontifex maximus , the highest religious office in the Roman state . 

 This may have been because Sabinus felt that the office was too powerful and was becoming a political weapon . 

 Sabinus also made the first of the many reforms to the taxation system , which were to have such a huge impact on the later Roman Empire . 

 He introduced a tax on the income of those who were taxed on the basis of their property and he also introduced a tax on the property of those who were taxed on the basis of their income . 

 Sabinus also tried to reform the tax system by introducing a tax on the value of the land . 

 Sabinus ' reforms of the tax system were not implemented , because he was deposed by the Senate and the Senate soon passed a law that abolished his reforms . 

 Sabinus is also known to have been the last emperor to appoint a consul before the accession of his successor . 

 After Sabinus , the emperors took on the role of appointing the consuls , which was a role that the emperors would retain for the next three centuries . 

 Sabinus ' short reign also saw him being the last emperor to be a cons

Champlin suggests that in some cases the reworking of images was carried out to " beautify " the portraits . The reworking of images of Nero has been compared to the reworking of images of Cleopatra in Egypt after her death .

### Primary sources

The sources for Nero's reign are relatively sparse. Suetonius was the only contemporary Roman historian to write about Nero, but he did not begin his work until the reign of Vespasian in 69, after Nero had committed suicide. Tacitus was a senator who wrote his work in the 90s, and his work was mainly concerned with the events of the late Republic. The first known biography of Nero was written by the 2nd-century writer Suetonius. This work, The Lives of the Twelve Caesars, covers the lives of twelve Roman emperors, from Julius Caesar to Domitian. Suetonius' work is a valuable source for Nero's life and reign, but he was not a contemporary of Nero, and much of his information is based on hearsay.

The earliest surviving work of history to mention Nero is the Historia Augusta, a collection of biographies of the Roman emperors, which was compiled in the 4th century. The Historia Augusta provides a fairly detailed account of Nero's reign, but it is not a reliable source of information, as it was written in the later part of the 4th century, and is likely to be a work of fiction.

The earliest extant biography of Nero is the biography written by the Roman historian Tacitus. Tacitus was born in the year 56, and died in 117. He was a senator during the reign of Nero, and he was one of the most famous Roman historians of the ancient world.

Nero was the first Roman emperor to be the subject of a biography, and Tacitus was the first to write one. Tacitus wrote his biography of Nero in the year 112, and it was the first biography of an emperor to be written in the Roman Empire. The biography of Nero by Tacitus is a valuable source of information for the study of Nero's life and reign.

* Nero , the emperor who reigned from 37 to 68 AD , is the most commonly proposed candidate .
* Emperor Domitian , who reigned from 81 to 96 AD , is another candidate , but this view is now considered unlikely .

## Tradition

There is no evidence that Paul was ever in Rome . However, a 19th-century tradition, based on the writings of St. Jerome and St. Augustine , holds that Paul was beheaded in Rome, during the reign of the Emperor Nero, who is said to have persecuted the early Christians. This tradition, however, has no historical foundation and is not supported by any contemporary records.

Main article: Paul's voyage to Rome

Acts 28:16–31, also known as the "two-year house arrest" (in the King James Version), describes the events of the Apostle Paul's last journey to Rome, where he is finally arrested and imprisoned. The account is the last of the Acts of the Apostles and is a combination of the letters of Paul to Philemon, Philippians, and Ephesians.

The account begins with the Apostle Paul's shipwreck on Malta, where he is rescued by the inhabitants of the island. The inhabitants, "barbarians" according to the author of Acts, show great kindness to Paul, who is given medical attention and fed by them.

After three months, Paul and the inhabitants of Malta decide to leave the island and sail to Rome, where Paul intends to appeal to Caesar for a fair hearing. The voyage takes two months, and the ship arrives at Rome in the summer of 61 AD.

Paul is met by Roman soldiers who take him to the Castra Praetoria, where he is held under house arrest. There, he meets two

The city was the center of commerce , banking , finance , retail , tourism , entertainment , media , arts , fashion , and other industries in the Philippines. In the 1990s , the Philippines' economy began to transition from an agricultural to a service economy . As a result , the country's business districts began to shift from Manila to the cities of Makati , Quezon City , and Taguig . In 1994 , the Philippine government enacted the Local Government Code which mandated the deconcentration of the national government's functions to the local government units . As a result , the national government began shifting some of its offices to the new cities . The Philippine Congress , the Supreme Court , and the Office of the President of the Philippines were relocated from Manila to Quezon City. The Department of Finance , the Department of Budget and Management , the Department of Justice , and the Department of Trade and Industry were relocated to Makati.

In 1997 , the Philippine Stock Exchange moved from the Manila Stock Exchange Building in Manila to the Philippine Stock Exchange Building in Makati .

 Most Filipinos are Roman Catholics , but there are also some Protestants , Aglipayans , Muslims , Buddhists , Iglesia ni Cristo , and others .
Roman Catholicism was first introduced in the Philippines by Spanish conquistadores and colonizers in the 16th century . In the 19th century , the Church became a prominent force in Philippine society , with its religious education and institutions becoming the primary source of formal education . However , the Church was also criticized for its support of the Spanish colonial government and its authoritarian rule , and for its insistence on the use of the Spanish language . After the establishment of the Philippine Republic in 1898 , the Church became a major target of nationalist attacks , and many of its properties were confiscated . In 1902 , the Philippine Assembly passed the Philippine Bill for the Separation of Church and State , which was later approved by the United States Congress in 1902 and ratified in 1903 .
In 1948 , the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines was established to represent the views of the Catholic Church in the country . The Conference was later reorganized in 1978 to become the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines , with the Conference's membership comprising the bishops of the country .
The Catholic Church is the largest religious organization in the Philippines , with over 80% of the country's population identifying as Catholic . The Church is also the largest provider of education in the country , with over 70% of the country's students attending Catholic schools .
The Catholic Church in the Philippines is headed by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines , which is composed of the bishops of the country .

## History

The Philippine International Convention Center, one of the country's most important convention centers

The Philippine International Convention Center in 2019

In the early 1970s, the national government decided to develop the area north of the Pasig River and south of the University of Santo Tomas campus as a business district. The Manila Development Authority (now the Manila City Government) was tasked to develop the area into a major business district. The area was formerly part of the Manila city proper and was part of the original plan for the city's urban development.

### Establishment of the University Belt

On May 15, 1976, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 844, which provided for the creation of the "Manila Business District", consisting of the area bounded by the Pasig River on the north, the Manila North Railroad on the east, the Manila South Harbor on the west, and the Manila North Harbor on the south. The decree also established the Manila Business District Authority (MBDA) to develop and manage the area. The MBDA was tasked to provide infrastructure, public utilities, and other basic services to the district, as well as to "encourage the establishment of other government offices, foreign and local banks, insurance companies, financial institutions, commercial enterprises, and other similar businesses."

The MBDA was composed of the Manila City Mayor as chairman, the Manila City Treasurer as vice chairman, and the Manila City Engineer as secretary. The MBDA was also tasked to coordinate with other government agencies in the implementation of the decree.

The Philippines were inhabited by hominins at least 67,000 years ago. The first archaeological evidence for the presence of Homo sapiens in the Philippines is dated at 47,000 years ago. Negritos were the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines, and were later joined by the Malays.

### Early history

Main article: History of the Philippines

The first recorded visits to the Philippines were made by the Chinese in the 10th century. The Chinese were traders who were sailing around the world and had trade routes through the Pacific Ocean. They found the islands and called them "Luzon" because of the legend of a beautiful princess named Luzon. The Chinese also made a lot of trade with the inhabitants of the Philippines. The Chinese also brought with them their religion, which was Taoism. The Chinese also brought their own culture, which included their language and their way of life.

The first recorded visit to the Philippines by a European was in 1521, when Ferdinand Magellan arrived on the island of Homonhon. The Portuguese explorer Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan on April 27, 15

> ( RUC )  and the Ulster Defence Association ( UDA )  in response to rioting . The people of Free Derry defended themselves and their property with firearms , petrol bombs , and homemade grenades .

Free Derry was not a physical place , but rather a state of mind . It was declared in opposition to the government of Northern Ireland and the RUC , which were seen as instruments of British rule . The people of Free Derry considered themselves to be citizens of Ireland , not of Northern Ireland , and declared Free Derry to be a part of the Republic of Ireland .

The Free Derry area was a centre of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement and the Irish nationalist campaign for civil rights and self-determination . The Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) held a number of meetings in the area and it was used as a base for guerrilla operations against the RUC and British Army .

The area was the scene of frequent confrontations between the RUC and the IRA , and was the site of several bloody shoot-outs between the two groups . The most famous of these occurred on 30 January 1972 when British soldiers shot dead fourteen unarmed civilians in what became known as the Bloody Sunday massacre .

The area was the scene of further violence in 1972 when loyalist paramilitaries attacked Catholic homes and businesses in the <unk> area , killing six people and destroying 150 homes . The RUC , which was supposed to be impartial , also attacked the area and shot dead three people .

The British government sent in troops to restore order , and the area was occupied by the British Army from 1972 to 1975 . After the British Army left , loyalist paramilitaries , backed by the RUC , carried out a campaign of intimidation and violence against the people of Free Derry .

The area was renamed Bogside in 1975 . The Bogside area of Derry has been the site of many riots and protests since the 1960s , but it is no longer considered to be part of Free Derry .

The government , however , did not lift the internment order , and by the end of 1971 , over 1, 200 people had been arrested and imprisoned without trial . In January 1972 , 26 people were killed in a single night , known as Bloody Sunday . In April 1972 , the government lifted the internment order , and the IRA were forced to the negotiating table .

The power-sharing executive collapsed in 1974 , and in the following year , the IRA resumed its armed campaign .

 rigorous action against the alleged housing discrimination , but they were stymied by the attitude of the unionist members of the Council. The Northern Ireland Housing Authority was set up in 1966 , but it was a slow-moving and bureaucratic body which did nothing to rectify the situation . In 1969 the Government appointed a Royal Commission on Housing in Northern Ireland . The Commission reported in 1971 . It recommended that the Northern Ireland Housing Authority should be replaced by a non-political housing executive , with the power to set up and run its own housing estates . The Executive should be able to build its own houses on sites provided by the Housing Authority and by local authorities . It was also recommended that a comprehensive house-building programme should be started , with particular emphasis on providing accommodation for the young . In 1972 the Northern Ireland Housing Authority was abolished , and the Housing Executive was set up . It had a wider remit than the Housing Authority , including the responsibility for improving existing houses , and the right to buy property from private owners . The Housing Executive was given an annual grant from the Department of the Environment , and it also borrowed money . The Housing Executive was set up in 1972 . Its first chairman was Sir Hugh Carson , who had been Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1965-66. Sir Hugh was a unionist . He was succeeded in 1975 by Sir Norman Stronge , who was a member of the Conservative and Unionist Party . In 1976 the Housing Executive was replaced by the Housing Executive and the Northern Ireland Housing Trust . This was a more ambitious body , which was given powers to borrow money , and to build its own houses on sites provided by the local authorities . It was also given the power to buy and sell property , and to set up housing estates .

The marching season was a period of heightened sectarian tensions and violence in Northern Ireland , with parades taking place throughout the summer and the potential for conflict rising in the run-up to the Twelfth .

The Order is based in Orange Hall in Belfast , and is a member of the World Alliance of Young Men's Christian Associations .

The Apprentice Boys are a Protestant fraternal organisation , and have their origins in a loyalist organisation established in 1927 . The organisation is based in the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall in Londonderry , and is a member of the World Alliance of Young Men's Christian Associations .

The 1969 march in Derry was the first parade held by the Apprentice Boys since the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was formed in 1967 . The march was originally scheduled to take place on 12 August , but was brought forward to 2 August because of the possibility of trouble on 12 August .

The RUC were widely held to have been involved in the killing of three young Catholic men in the Springfield Road area of Belfast on 14 October 1969 . The killings , known as the Springhill massacre , had been carried out by members of the RUC's Special Patrol Group (SPG) , a covert sectarian paramilitary unit .
The Special Patrol Group was established in 1966 by the RUC and British Army and was made up of 500 members of the RUC and 100 members of the British Army . The SPG was based in the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast , and was notorious for its brutality . The SPG was disbanded in 1970 , and some of its members transferred to the B Specials , a paramilitary unit made up of mainly Protestant former soldiers .
The B Specials were disbanded in 1970 after a British Army inquiry found that they had committed widespread human rights abuses , including murder , torture and kidnapping . The RUC was also disbanded in 1970 .

The IRA did not initiate the violence . It was the continuation of a long-term campaign of sectarian attacks on Catholics by the Orange Order . Protestant paramilitaries had killed 15 Catholic civilians during the 1960s . The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( NICRA ) was formed in 1967 to campaign for civil rights for Catholics in Northern Ireland . It was heavily involved in a campaign of civil disobedience in 1968, culminating in the 1968 Northern Ireland riots . The campaign was led by Catholics, but included Protestants and was supported by some unionists . The violence of 1969 was a response to the civil rights movement .


In the 1960s, the IRA had been inactive militarily . However, in 1969 the IRA launched a new campaign . The IRA's goals were to unite Ireland , to end discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland and to end British rule in Northern Ireland . The campaign of violence began with the IRA's attacks on British forces in Northern Ireland . It later spread to the Republic of Ireland and to Britain . The IRA's strategy was to force the British Government to agree to a united Ireland by launching a campaign of violence .


 The British Government responded to the violence by deploying more troops to Northern Ireland . In 1969, 21,000 troops were stationed there . In 1970, 30,000 troops were stationed there . The troops were deployed in support of the RUC and the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) . The British Government also introduced internment in Northern Ireland . The internment policy was initially supported by many unionists, but it alienated many Catholics . The IRA also targeted Protestants .


In 1969, the IRA killed 26 people . The IRA killed 208 people in 1970 . The IRA killed 244 people in 1971 . The IRA killed 215 people in 1972 . In 1972, the IRA launched a campaign of bombing in Britain . The IRA's

The Irish Republican Army (IRA) was a republican paramilitary organisation dedicated to the establishment of a republic in Ireland and the withdrawal of the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary from Northern Ireland . The IRA's campaign was directed towards what it called the "British occupation of Ireland" , which it deemed to have begun in 1690 , and was directed towards the establishment of a united Ireland .
The IRA began in the 1910s as a paramilitary wing of the Sinn Féin political party . It was originally known as the Irish Volunteers . In 1919 , Sinn Féin leaders founded the Irish Republican Army as a separate organisation. The IRA began its campaign with raids and ambushes against British forces in Ireland . It later expanded its campaign to encompass Northern Ireland , where it engaged in a violent campaign against the government and its security forces , which was directed at both unionists and loyalists , and also against the Catholic and nationalist population . The IRA also carried out attacks against the British mainland , particularly during the Troubles .
The IRA began to lose support in the late 1970s , when it killed two British soldiers in a bomb attack in London . In 1997 , the IRA announced an end to its armed campaign and stated that it was prepared to accept Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom .
The IRA's activities led to a number of controversies . The organisation has been accused of using the Provisional Irish Republican Army name in order to confuse the public and conceal its involvement in criminal activity . The IRA has been accused of a number of human rights abuses , including torture and murder of those it considered to be "informers" . It has also been accused of carrying out a number of attacks on Catholic civilians .
The IRA's campaign has been condemned by a number of commentators , including former IRA member and Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams . The IRA has also been condemned by the British government , the Irish government , the United States government and the European Union .

The Provisionals were initially supported by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) , but as NICRA failed to achieve its aims and the British government failed to implement reforms , the Provisionals began to believe that they would have to take matters into their own hands . The Provisional IRA launched its first attack on the British army in October 1969 .

### The Troubles

Further information: The Troubles

By 1970 , the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) were involved in countering the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland . In 1971 the Provisional IRA launched its campaign of bombing and shooting in the Republic of Ireland . The campaign was aimed at the British government and the RUC , but also at the Protestant population in the north of Ireland .

In 1972 the Provisionals killed British soldiers and policemen in a series of attacks which led to the introduction of internment . In August 1972 , the Provisionals carried out an attack on the British army and the RUC in the village of Bloody Sunday , killing 14 unarmed civil rights protestors . The killings caused outrage throughout the world , and led to the establishment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry . The inquiry found that the soldiers who fired the shots were not guilty of murder or manslaughter , but the families of the dead and injured were awarded compensation .

In the late 1970s and early 1980s , the Provisional IRA , which had by now become the dominant republican group in Northern Ireland , carried out a series of bombing attacks in Britain . The Provisional IRA also carried out a number of attacks in the Republic of Ireland , including a bombing in Dublin in 1974 in which 26 people were killed .

The Provisional IRA also carried out a number of attacks on the British army and the RUC , including the 1982 attack on the RUC base in Enniskillen , in which 11 people were killed . The Enniskillen bombing was the deadliest attack on the British security forces during the

 syste 1970 , the army was ordered to make a full investigation of the riots , which was followed by a series of trials . At the trials , the defence lawyers attacked the credibility of the prosecution evidence , and were able to demonstrate that the prosecution witnesses were not always reliable . The evidence of the prosecution witnesses was also open to criticism , because the witnesses had been arrested by the army , and had been threatened with death if they refused to cooperate with the authorities . The army's investigation of the riots was also criticised because it had been conducted by the army , and the army was seen as a ' secret police ' . The trials also raised a number of questions about the role of the army in the riots . The army had been given the task of restoring order in the city , and had arrested thousands of people . The trials showed that many of the arrests had been made on the basis of hearsay evidence , and that many of the arrests had been made in the absence of any evidence that the accused had committed a crime .

 A few days after the killings , a riot erupted on the Creggan Estate in Derry . The riot was started by a group of young men who threw stones at British Army patrols . The British Army responded with live fire and the riot continued for several days .

In 1972 , the Provisional IRA began to use its new .303 rifles to attack British Army patrols and checkpoints . The Provisional IRA also began to target the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and its main base in the city . During the year , the Provisional IRA carried out several attacks on the RUC in Derry . The most famous of these was the attack on the RUC base in the city in April 1972 . The Provisional IRA also carried out several attacks on the British Army in the city in 1972 . The most famous of these was the attack on the British Army base in the city in October 1972 .

In 1973 , the Provisional IRA carried out several attacks on the British Army in the city . The most famous of these was the attack on the British Army base in the city in October 1973 .

## Attack on RUC base

On 16 April 1972 , a unit of the Provisional IRA attacked the RUC base in the city . The RUC base was located in a former army barracks on the edge of the city centre . The Provisional IRA fired a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) at the RUC base . The grenade failed to penetrate the building and the Provisional IRA withdrew . The attack was filmed by a BBC camera crew and was broadcast on the BBC news . The attack on the RUC base was the first time that the Provisional IRA had used an RPG in the conflict .

The following day , 31 January 1972 , British soldiers fired on a civilian crowd in Derry . Eight people died and 13 were injured . The following day , the IRA exploded a car bomb outside the British Army's headquarters in Belfast , killing nine soldiers and wounding 160 people . The IRA also attacked a barracks in Armagh , and killed two soldiers in a bomb attack in Ballykelly , County Londonderry .
There was a surge of violence throughout the rest of the year . The IRA attacked a British Army patrol in Ballymurphy , killing one soldier and wounding another . The British Army responded by killing five civilians in the area . The IRA also killed six British soldiers in a bomb attack on a military vehicle in Ballygawley . The IRA's campaign of violence was matched by the British Army's , and by 1972 , the level of violence was at its highest . The IRA killed 132 people , while the British Army killed 268 . The IRA also carried out a number of bombings in Northern Ireland , and in England . The most significant bombing was the 1972 Birmingham pub bombings , which killed 21 people . The IRA also carried out a number of bombings in England , including the 1972 Guildford pub bombings , which killed five people .
The violence of 1972 was matched by the level of political activity . In January , the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( NICRA ) held a protest march in Derry . The march was stopped by the police , and many of the protesters were beaten by the police . The following day , a civil rights march was held in Belfast , which was also stopped by the police . The marchers were attacked by loyalists , and the police failed to intervene . The police also failed to intervene when loyalists attacked Catholic homes in the New Lodge area of Belfast .

During the day the B Specials were brought out to support the RUC , and the two groups together were able to push the rioters back . However , the RUC and the B Specials were also attacked , and on the night of 14 August 1971 , the RUC withdrew from the city centre , allowing the B Specials to take over the security of the area . This was a significant turning point in the history of the Troubles , and the city of Derry became a no-go area for the RUC , with the B Specials , who were more willing to use lethal force , taking over the security of the city .

 The B Specials , along with the RUC , were involved in the shootings in Derry which became known as Bloody Sunday . Following the introduction of internment , the B Specials were no longer permitted to patrol the city , and the RUC took over responsibility for security in Derry . However , this did not mean that the area was no longer a no-go area , as the RUC , in the face of continuing resistance , were unwilling to enter the city . As a result , the area was effectively controlled by the IRA , and the RUC were unwilling to enter the area in order to arrest or detain republicans .

 The introduction of internment had failed to end the violence in Northern Ireland , and following Bloody Sunday , the British government decided to introduce the British Army into Northern Ireland . The British Army was initially used to replace the RUC in the city centre of Derry , with the intention that the army would be used to restore control to the area . However , this did not happen , and in October 1971 , the army was deployed to the Falls Road and the Shankill Road , the two main nationalist and unionist districts of Belfast . This deployment did not result in an end to the violence , and over the next few years the British Army would be deployed throughout Northern Ireland , and would remain there for 30 years .

The IRA and the British Army then began to engage in an open gunfight in the Bogside , which lasted for a week and resulted in the deaths of 32 people . In the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday shootings in 1972 , the IRA launched the Balcombe Street Siege in London , which lasted for five days and resulted in the deaths of two British soldiers . On 8 December 1972 , the IRA launched an attack on the British Army base at Ballykelly , which resulted in the deaths of five British soldiers . In response , the British Army launched Operation Motorman in January 1973 , which resulted in the disbanding of the IRA's Third Battalion and the internment of its members .

 The IRA's campaign in the Republic of Ireland was largely based on the use of guns and bombs , but in the North the IRA's main weapons were the ' Long War ' and the hunger strike . The Long War was an IRA campaign to put pressure on the British government to withdraw from Northern Ireland by means of a bombing campaign against targets in England , which began in 1972 and was to continue until 1997 .
 The hunger strike was a form of protest against the British government's refusal to recognise the IRA's prisoners as political prisoners . The hunger strike was to become a tactic used by the IRA in the 1980s to put pressure on the British government .
 In 1971 the British government had been brought to its knees by a miners' strike .
 The IRA's ' Strategy and Tactics ' document of 1977 made clear that it was prepared to use violence to achieve its aims .
 The ' Birmingham Six ' were six men convicted of bombing the Birmingham pubs in 1974 . The men had been convicted on the basis of the testimony of a single police officer , who later admitted he had fabricated the evidence . In 1991 the men were released from prison on the basis of new evidence .
 In 1972 the British government had withdrawn from power in the Republic of Ireland after a general election which had resulted in a coalition of parties which were opposed to British rule .
 In 1972 the British government had decided to end direct rule in Northern Ireland and had established a devolved power-sharing assembly in Belfast . The assembly was dominated by the Unionist parties , and the main nationalist party , the SDLP , did not take its seats .
The following year the British government decided to bring the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) into the power-sharing assembly .
 In 1973 the British government decided to end direct rule in Northern Ireland and to establish a new administration called the Northern Ireland Executive . The Executive was to be led by the Unionist leader Brian Faulkner .

 maintained that they were willing to accept a ceasefire if the British Government would open the first round of negotiations . However , the British Government maintained that they would not negotiate with the Provisional IRA until they had first agreed to a ceasefire . In addition , the British Government was also unwilling to engage with the PIRA in talks on a political basis , believing that the republican movement was not interested in a political solution .

> View of the World from 9th Avenue ) is a 1961 one-act play by the American playwright Neil Simon . It is a comic monologue written for Zero Mostel , who originated the role in the play's 1961 Broadway production .

In 1962, it was adapted for the screen as View from the Bridge .

## Plot

The play is a comic monologue about a man who works in the post office on 9th Avenue in Manhattan , New York City. The man, in his mid-fifties, has been in this position for twenty years and has grown accustomed to his routine and to the life of a single man. He is a New Yorker through and through, and his monologue is filled with references to the city and its people.

The man is a romantic, a sentimentalist, and a dreamer. He fantasizes about the life he could have had and the woman he could have had it with. He is also a devoutly religious man and he talks about his faith and his church with equal passion.

## 1961 Broadway production

The play was first produced by David Merrick on Broadway at the Ambassador Theatre on October 10, 1961. Zero Mostel starred in the role of the postman and was directed by Mike Nichols . The play ran for 1,151 performances.

### Original cast

* Zero Mostel as the Postman

### Critical response

The New York Times reviewer Brooks Atkinson called the play "a most amusing monologue" and praised Mostel's performance as "a first-rate performance". He wrote: "The postman is a New Yorker who has been born, lived, worked and worshipped in the city. He is a jolly man with a sentimental streak, a great admirer of the Italian opera and a devotee of the ladies, both young and old. He is also a devout Jew, and the play is as much a religious allegory as a satire on the city and its people. The postman is a natural storyteller, and Mr. Mostel plays him with a sure sense of comedy and a droll and compelling quality of speech. His performance

The illustration was so popular that it was featured on the cover of the Post on October 7, 1944. It was also featured on the cover of the November 25, 1944, issue of The New Yorker. The Post edition was sold in the thousands, and it was reprinted on a variety of items, including bumper stickers.

The illustration was a parody of a World War II propaganda poster that had been used by the United States War Department. The poster, titled "The Fighting Spirit of America", showed an American soldier holding a rifle and was based on a painting by Howard Chandler Christy. The soldier is depicted as an American Indian, with a headdress that was more typical of a Plains Indian rather than a Northeastern Indian. The poster was first used as a recruiting poster, and was then used to promote war bonds.

The illustration was included in a book of Fulford's work published in 1945, titled View of the World from 9th Avenue. It was included in another book of Fulford's work in 1946, titled View of the World from 9th Avenue and Elsewhere.

THE CONTROVERSY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY
Recently, I was informed that the Sarawak Forestry Department is in a serious financial crisis. There is a shortage of funds and some of its projects have been postponed. This is due to the fact that the Department is not receiving the expected revenue from the sale of timber licenses.
The controversy of the Sarawak Forestry Department is one of the major problems in Sarawak. It is also the subject of a number of legal cases. In 2003, a group of Sarawak NGOs, including the Sarawak Dayak Iban Association (SDIA) and the Sarawak Dayak Iban Association (SDIA), filed a lawsuit against the Sarawak Forestry Department. The case was heard in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. In both cases, the Court found that the Sarawak Forestry Department was not properly administering its licensing system.
The Sarawak Forestry Department is a department of the Sarawak State Government. It is responsible for the management of the state's forests. The Department is also responsible for the administration of the state's timber licenses.
The Sarawak Forestry Department has a number of responsibilities. It is responsible for the management of the state's forests. It is also responsible for the administration of the state's timber licenses. The Department is also responsible for the administration of the state's timber licenses.

## History

NY 93 was assigned c. 1925 as part of the realignment of NY 12A (now NY 12) to the west, running from NY 12's former route at the south end of the village of Richfield Springs to the village of Richfield Springs. In 1927, the route was extended south to NY 12's former route at the north end of the village of Oxford.

NY 93 was assigned in 1930 to a new alignment that bypassed Richfield Springs to the west. The route began at NY 12A in Richfield Springs and proceeded east to Oxford, where it connected to NY 12A's former route. The former alignment of NY 93 from Richfield Springs to Oxford became NY 295. In 1932, the route was extended south from Oxford to NY 165 in Oxford.

## History

The idea of a permanent memorial to the war dead came from the Reverend David Railton . In 1915 he was appointed as a chaplain to the Western Front and soon after his arrival he was involved in the evacuation of wounded soldiers from the battlefield at Ypres .

On the way to the dressing station , he came across a group of soldiers who had been left behind because they were too badly injured to continue the journey . The dead were placed on the edge of the road with no identification and no thought of any kind of permanent memorial . 

This sight affected Railton deeply . He recalled later that he was struck by the fact that the dead were of all nationalities , ages and ranks . He felt that it would be a fitting tribute to the soldiers who had died to have a permanent memorial to them . He said that he decided then that "somewhere in the future there should be a place of rest for these heroes of the battlefield , where they could be identified and honoured for their sacrifice in the cause of freedom . "

He returned to the base , collected some stones , and placed one on each grave . He also wrote a poem entitled " In Flanders Fields " which was published in Punch magazine in December 1915 .

Railton then returned to the battlefield and asked the officers if they would allow him to erect a permanent memorial to the dead . They agreed and a cross was erected . 

Railton then returned to England and wrote to the then Secretary of State for War , Lord Kitchener , and the Prime Minister , Herbert Asquith . 

In his letter to Kitchener , Railton suggested that " a national memorial should be erected to the memory of the dead of the war . " He also suggested that the crosses be replaced by a " monumental cross in bronze or stone " . 

Kitchener forwarded Railton's letter to Sir Edwin Lutyens who had been commissioned to design the Cenotaph in London . Lut

 On 30 September 1914 , Ware arrived in the French port of Marseilles , France , to supervise the organization of British Red Cross ambulances . He found that the French were well prepared to receive wounded soldiers , but that the Germans were less well prepared . He decided that if a system of cemeteries for German soldiers could be established , it would help to foster a sense of fair play and mutual respect between the two sides . 

 Ware's first cemetery , the St Symphorien Military Cemetery , was established at Mons , Belgium , on 1 November 1914 , the day after the first British soldiers were killed in action in the Battle of Mons . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1915 for his efforts . 

 By the end of the war, Ware had supervised the establishment of 130 cemeteries and 200 burial plots . 

 After the war , he became the Director-General of the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) , which was established on 19 June 1917 , with the purpose of creating a permanent system of graves and memorials for the 1,000,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who had died in World War I .

> m m e m o r a t e d , and that this commemoration would be on a national scale . In the years following the war , the question of how to commemorate the dead was debated at all levels of society . The desire to commemorate war dead on a national scale was especially apparent in the first decade of the 20th century , and the memorial movement gained a considerable amount of momentum. The Government's decision to erect a national memorial was a further stimulus to the movement , and in 1919 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established . Although the Commission had been given responsibility for the commemoration of war dead , it was not until 1920 that the first cemeteries were opened . The years 1921-26 were the most important in the development of the Commission's work , as it was during this period that the first cemeteries were established in France and Belgium . The Commission's work was, however, hampered by the onset of the Great Depression . In 1929 the Commission's finances were in a dire state , and the War Office was compelled to provide £150,000 to cover the deficit . In 1939 , the Commission's finances were in a more stable position , and the number of cemeteries established was at a record level . The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 once again placed the Commission in a difficult position , as its work was once more severely hampered by the outbreak of war . The Commission's financial position was once more a cause for concern , and in 1941 the War Office provided a further £250,000 to cover the deficit . The Commission's financial position continued to be a problem for the Commission during the Second World War , and in 1944 the Government was compelled to provide a further £300,000 to cover the deficit . In 1945 , the Commission's financial position was at its worst , and in 1946 the Government was compelled to provide a further £1,500,000 to cover the deficit . The Commission's financial position was once again stable by the mid-1950s ,

> ement the enemy image of the British as " gravediggers " . The committee also recommended that no memorials should be erected in the cemeteries that bore the name of a single regiment , battalion or corps . It was felt that these monuments would create a division between the " old soldiers " and the " new " . The committee's final report stated that " the cemeteries should be treated as one memorial " . A large number of crosses and headstones were erected in the cemeteries , but the committee's recommendation to avoid regimental , battalion and corps memorials was ignored . The cemeteries were regarded as a single memorial , but were divided by class . The cemeteries were designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield and were divided into eight zones . Each zone was dedicated to a different service , with the 1st and 2nd Zones reserved for the army , the 3rd for the navy and the 4th for the Royal Flying Corps . The 5th Zone was dedicated to the British Empire and included Canada , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . The 6th Zone was for the United States , while the 7th was for France and the 8th for Belgium and Italy . The French and Belgians were the only nationalities that received separate zones . The cemeteries were also divided by denomination , with Roman Catholic , Anglican and non-denominational sections . The British Army was divided into four divisions , with the 1st and 2nd Divisions allocated to the 1st and 2nd Zones , the 3rd Division to the 3rd Zone and the 4th Division to the 4th Zone . The 5th and 6th Zones were allocated to the Royal Flying Corps , while the 7th and 8th Zones were for the Royal Navy .

A few days after the publication of Graves of the Fallen , Sir Henry Seymour , the Secretary of State for War , wrote to the Imperial War Graves Commission : " I am sure you will agree with me that the views expressed in the article [Graves of the Fallen] are those of the Commission . I do not think it is desirable to alter the views in any way . "

Sir John Simon argued that the policy of repatriation was a 'moral obligation ' and that the 'modern conception of warfare is that it is not warfare at all , but a struggle between two nations who have to fight , and to fight , too , for the lives of their soldiers . ' 17 The Secretary of State for War , William Bridgeman , argued that the policy of repatriation was in fact a 'moral obligation ' but that it was not possible to carry out the policy in practice . He explained that the policy was not being applied to France or Belgium because of the ' special position of France ' . In a speech that was later to become infamous , Bridgeman argued that the policy of repatriation would 'only encourage the German Government to carry on the policy of the Krupp gun . ' 18 The debate was adjourned until 15 May , when the Secretary of State for War returned to the House to reiterate his position . 19 The House of Commons passed a motion on 16 May 1920 that the policy of repatriation should be adopted . This resulted in a change of policy and the Secretary of State for War wrote to the British Ambassador in Germany to explain the change of policy , stating that 'in the light of the strong feeling in this country as to the duty of repatriation , the Government have decided that it is not possible for them to go on with the policy which they have hitherto pursued . ' 20 The repatriation policy was implemented immediately and the Secretary of State for War wrote to the German Government on 18 May 1920 to explain the change of policy . The German Government replied on 22 May 1920 , accepting the British policy and stating that 'the German Government are prepared to proceed at once with the repatriation of the bodies of British soldiers . ' 21 The repatriation policy was implemented over the next few months . 22 A report by the British Army on the repatriation policy stated that 'the policy was to bury in the old cemeteries , as far as possible , the remains of the British soldiers , and to repatriate the bodies of the German soldiers .

The circular walk was also intended to give a sense of being part of a community , with the ability to see all the graves . The garden was intended to be a place of contemplation and remembrance , with plants chosen for their long flowering seasons and their scent . The garden was designed to be maintained by the Commission . 

 In 1924 , the Commission were asked to consider the problems of a large number of casualties being buried in the same cemetery . The result was the policy of "concentration" . This was based on the principle that a cemetery should contain all the graves from a particular battle or campaign , and that the battlefield should be commemorated by a single memorial .

The CWGC was created on 11 November 1917, the first anniversary of the armistice that ended the First World War. Its creation was a result of the international agreements reached at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, in which the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa pledged to maintain the graves of the war dead of the British Empire. The United Kingdom government invited representatives from the five countries to discuss the implementation of this pledge, and the first meeting was held on 24 May 1919 in London.
The Commission was formally established on 19 June 1919 by King George V, when he signed a royal charter. The five founding member countries were Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom. The organisation's first chairman was the Earl of Onslow, who was appointed to the position on 25 June 1919. The organisation's name was changed from "The Imperial War Graves Commission" to "The Commonwealth War Graves Commission" in 1921.
The CWGC was responsible for the commemoration of 1,700,000 Commonwealth service members who died in the First World War, and of 67,000 service members who died in the Second World War. It was responsible for

## History

The Type UB I was an adaptation of the Type UB II , a class of small coastal submarines built for the Imperial German Navy . The UB I design was intended for operations in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea , where larger boats could not operate. 

The UB I had a similar design to the Type UB II . The boat was 41.75 m (137 ft 4 in) long overall , with a beam of 4.1 m (13 ft 5 in) and a draft of 3.0 m (9 ft 10 in) . She displaced 278 t (274 long tons) on the surface and 310 t (306 long tons) submerged. The UB I had a crew of 2 officers and 17 enlisted men.

For surface running, the UB I had two 220 PS (160 kW; 217 hp) diesel engines , each driving one propeller shaft . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 8.0 kn (9.2 mph; 14.8 km/h) and a submerged speed of 6.6 kn (7.6 mph; 12.2 km/h). When submerged, the boat could operate for 4 hours at 3 kn (3.5 mph; 5.6 km/h); when surfaced, she could travel for 450 nautical miles (830 km; 520 mi) at 6 kn (7 mph; 9.2 km/h).

The UB I was armed with two 50 cm (20 in) torpedo tubes in the bow . She could carry 4 torpedoes .

## Service

The first Type UB I was launched in October 1915 . The UB I was also operated by the Austro-Hungarian Navy . The UB I was also operated by the Bulgarian Navy .

 The UB-IIs were the most numerous type of submarine built during the First World War. They were also the most successful class of German submarine of the war , with 138 ships sunk, for a loss of only 16 submarines.

## Service history

### Germany

The German submarines were built to operate in the North Sea and English Channel , but also served in the Mediterranean and Black Seas.

The UB-IIs were the first submarines to be designed as part of the German Navy's expansion programme, following the 1908 enactment of the Naval Law . They were designed by the German Navy's in-house design office, Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw ( IvS ), based on the earlier U-II submarine , but were larger, faster and more capable than the U-IIs, and had a longer endurance.

The UB-IIs had a length of 56.85 metres ( 186 ft 6 in ) overall, a beam of 5.80 metres ( 19 ft 0 in ) and a mean draft of 3.50 metres ( 11 ft 6 in ) . They displaced 540 tonnes ( 530 long tons ) surfaced and 640 tonnes ( 630 long tons ) submerged. The submarines were powered by two 6-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of 800 metric horsepower (590 kW; 790 shp) on the surface and 900 PS (662 kW; 890 shp) while submerged. They had a maximum surface speed of 13.5 knots (25.0 km/h; 15.5 mph) and a submerged speed of 7.5 knots (13.9 km/h; 8.6 mph). They could operate at a depth of 50 metres (160 ft) for 4 hours, and at a depth of 100 metres (330 ft) for 3

> the North Sea . The German Navy's U-boats were too large to operate in these shallow waters and the German Army 's first submarines , the Type UB I , were too small . The only available solution was to adapt the Austrian Navy 's Type U-9 , a submarine designed for service in the Adriatic Sea . The Austrian Navy had ordered ten Type U-9 submarines from the German shipyard Germania in 1910 and the first of these, U-9 , was launched on 19 May 1911 . The submarines were designed by the Austrian Navy 's naval architect Hans Karrasch and were based on the earlier Type U-1 German submarine .



The Type U-9 had a length of 45.8 m , a beam of 4.25 m and a draft of 2.8 m . She had a displacement of 345 tonnes surfaced and 430 tonnes submerged . She was propelled by two diesel engines of 880 bhp each driving two shafts , which gave her a maximum speed of 14 knots (26 km/h) when surfaced and 8.5 knots (15.7 km/h) when submerged . She could dive to a depth of 50 m . The submarine carried four torpedoes and had a crew of 25 .



The Austrian Navy ordered a second batch of ten Type U-9 submarines from the German shipyard AG Vulcan Stettin in 1911 and the first of these, U-11 , was launched on 28 July 1912 . The submarines were designed by the Austrian Navy 's naval architect Hans Karrasch and were based on the earlier Type U-9 .



The Type U-11 had a length of 45.8 m , a beam of 4.25 m and a draft of 2.8 m . She had a displacement of 345 tonnes surfaced and 430 tonnes submerged . She was propelled by two diesel engines of 880 bhp each driving two shafts , which gave her a maximum speed of 1

 The UB I was to have two forward torpedo tubes and one stern tube . The armament was a single 50 mm (2 in ) gun and a single 8 mm (0.31 in) machine gun .

## Ships in class

Four submarines were ordered and built by Germaniawerft in Kiel , with the submarines being delivered between 20 September 1914 and 16 October 1914 . The UB I class was the first class of submarines in the Imperial German Navy to be built entirely in Germany , as the earlier Type UB II class had been built in Spain . The UB I class was the first class of submarines to be built in Germany to be fitted with diesel engines .

## Operational history

On 10 October 1914 , U 1 became the first submarine in the Imperial German Navy to sink an enemy ship , when it sank the British steamer SS Aegir in the North Sea .

> 1⁄2 metres ( 11 ft 6 in ) wide . The boats were also slightly lighter , with a displacement of 115 tonnes ( 113 long tons ) , and had a single bow torpedo tube .

## Description

The boats had a crew of four officers and thirty-one men. They carried one 50 centimetres (20 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo and one 100 millimetres (3.9 @.@ 0 in ) gun . The gun was set in a fixed mount and the torpedo was fitted externally on the boat's deck. The gun had a firing range of about 3,000 metres ( 3,300 yd ) and the torpedo a range of 1,500 metres ( 1,600 yd ).

## Construction

The boats were laid down between 1912 and 1914 and launched between 1913 and 1914. The boats served in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. UB-10 was one of the first German submarines to be sunk in World War I when she was rammed and sunk by the British destroyer HMS Tipperary off the coast of Scotland on 22 September 1914.

The diesel engines could propel the boats to a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km/h ; 12 mph ) on the surface and 6 knots ( 11 km/h ; 6.9 mph ) while submerged . The boats had a surface endurance of 3,500 nautical miles ( 6,500 km ; 4,000 mi ) at 8 knots ( 15 km/h ; 9.2 mph ) . While submerged , they had a maximum endurance of 39 nmi ( 72 km ; 45 mi ) at 4 knots ( 7.4 km/h ; 4.6 mph ) .

 The boats were armed with two 50 cm ( 19.7 in ) torpedo tubes in the bow and two 50 cm ( 19.7 in ) torpedo tubes in the stern . They carried six torpedoes, for a total of eight torpedoes .

## Construction

U-55 was ordered on 29 September 1916 and launched on 22 April 1917 . She was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 13 July 1917 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Hans Bauer .

## Service history

U-55 operated in the Mediterranean and in the Baltic . U-55 was surrendered to the Allies at Harwich on 22 November 1918 . She was later sold to the United States on 12 January 1921 and renamed USS R-15 .

The process of shipping the submarines by rail was not without its problems . At least one submarine , UB-17 , was shipped via rail and had to be re-assembled at Harwich . The process of re-assembling a submarine from a knock down kit was very time consuming and the submarines had to be re-assembled quickly to avoid damage .

## Service history

On 23 February 1915 UB-1 was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy . UB-1 was the only boat of her class to serve in the Mediterranean . UB-1 served with the German Mediterranean submarine flotilla . On 26 February 1915 UB-1 was under the command of Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Fritz von Ihering when she was ordered to sea . On 1 March 1915 UB-1 left Messina and sailed for Malta . On 1 March 1915 at 17.45 hours UB-1 surfaced in Grand Harbour , Malta . At 17.55 hours UB-1 fired a torpedo at the cruiser HMS Hampshire . The torpedo missed its target and detonated prematurely . The explosion killed the admiral of the Mediterranean Fleet , Vice Admiral Sir John Jellicoe , and the British Director of Naval Intelligence , Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon .

On 23 March 1915 UB-1 was ordered to the Aegean Sea . On 23 April 1915 at 16.20 hours UB-1 torpedoed the British armed merchant cruiser HMS Hyacinth , which was escorting a convoy of merchant ships , off Cape Matapan , Greece . The torpedo struck the Hyacinth's bow and detonated prematurely . The explosion killed six of the Hyacinth's crew and injured two more .

 During the course of the war all of the Type UB I boats were reassigned to the Flanders Flotilla . The only boats which were not involved in the fighting were those which were reassigned to the Mediterranean Flotilla .

### Flanders Flotilla

The Flanders Flotilla was established on 23 July 1915 under the command of Korvettenkapitän (KK) Karl Dönitz . The flotilla was based at Zeebrugge with detachments operating from Ostend and Bruges . The flotilla operated in the Channel, the North Sea and the English coast .

The first operational sortie of the flotilla was made on 27 July 1915 with the boats operating in the vicinity of Dunkirk .

On 26 August 1915 the first operational patrol of the flotilla was made by boats of the Flanders Flotilla . The patrol was made from Zeebrugge to Dover . The patrol was conducted in the face of the strongest defence that had ever been encountered by the U-boats . The boats attacked and sank the British steamer City of Berlin . The patrol was also conducted in the face of a strong enemy air attack and in the face of a major British air attack against Zeebrugge on the night of 28/29 August 1915 . The flotilla was the only German unit to operate in the face of the strongest enemy defences .

On 17 October 1915 the first operational patrol of the Type UB II was made by boats of the Flanders Flotilla . The boats operated in the English Channel .

On 21 November 1915 the flotilla was reassigned to the Navy Command in Kiel .

The flotilla was reformed in June 1916 at Zeebrugge .

On 20 October 1916 the flotilla was reassigned to the Navy Command in Wilhelmshaven .

### The Type UB III

Further information: Type UB III

The Type UB III was an improved version of the Type UB II . The Type UB III displaced 1,320 @-@ tons ( 1,340 t ) surfaced and 1,470 @-@ tons ( 1,500 t ) submerged . It was 219.2 ft ( 66.8 m ) long, had a beam of 22.4 ft ( 6.8 m ) and a draft of 13.6 ft ( 4.1 m ) . The Type UB III was powered by two 6 cylinder V 2 @,@ 300 @-@ hp ( 224 kW ) MAN M 6 V 2 @,@ 300 @-@ hp ( 224 kW ) diesel engines and two 1 @,@ 000 @-@ hp ( 750 kW ) electric motors. The UB III had a maximum speed of 14.8 @-@ knots ( 17.2 mph; 27.7 km/h) @-@ on the surface and 11.1 @-@ knots ( 12.8 mph; 20.6 km/h) @-@ in water . The Type UB III could dive to a depth of 220 @-@ feet ( 67 m ) .

The Type UB III had a crew of 32 , and carried 22 torpedoes .

> until the end of the war . The Allies soon became aware of the new German submarines , and as the war continued the British and French began to take countermeasures .

### Axis countermeasures

The British Admiralty quickly became aware of the U-boat's new "tin tadpole" submarines and began to take countermeasures. A British report of 26 June 1915 describes the submarine as:

... a small submarine of very powerful torpedo tubes with a very heavy conning tower and periscope. It is reported that the boat is very noisy and that the periscope is not reliable.

British ships, such as the light cruiser HMS Hyacinth, were equipped with sound-locating devices, and several British ships were sunk by these devices.

### German countermeasures

During the war, the German Navy developed a number of countermeasures to protect their submarines. One of these was the "Narwal" or "Narwal I" , which was a ballast tank that could be quickly flooded or emptied to change the trim of the submarine.

### War's end

With the end of the war, the German Navy was ordered to surrender all its submarines and most of them were scuttled . The "tin tadpoles" were among those that were scrapped .

The importance of Gibraltar to the British Empire and its allies was such that Adolf Hitler ordered the British Rock to be captured at all costs. In the early stages of the war , German forces attempted to capture Gibraltar by air and sea. On 24 July 1940 , the day after Operation Sealion , a German air attack on Gibraltar was launched .

Following the end of the war , the military presence in Gibraltar was reduced . The last military personnel were withdrawn in 1992.

## Pre-war

Prior to the outbreak of war , Gibraltar was a major naval base and naval shipbuilding centre for the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. 

During the 1930s , the Gibraltar Defence Force was established and the Royal Air Force established a number of military installations.

## The Battle of Gibraltar

Main article: Battle of Gibraltar (1940)

On 24 July 1940 , Operation Felix , the German invasion of Britain, began . The German invasion of Gibraltar was to be launched simultaneously with the invasion of Britain. A German air attack was launched on Gibraltar the following day.

### The air attack

The attack was led by 44 Heinkel He 111 bombers of KG 27 and KG 28. The air attack lasted for 70 minutes and was met by British anti-aircraft fire. Six German aircraft were shot down.

### The naval attack

On 26 July 1940 , the German battleship Gneisenau and the light cruiser Scharnhorst attempted to break through the British blockade of the Bay of Biscay. The German ships were attacked by British destroyers and cruisers.

### The German occupation of the Isla Verde

On 26 July 1940 , the German cruiser Deutschland , which was en route to attack the British fleet at Gibraltar , encountered British destroyers and was forced to withdraw to the French port of Bordeaux . On 29 July 1940 , the German cruiser Admir

The British maintained a significant military presence in Gibraltar until 1992 . In 1984 , the Royal Air Force (RAF) transferred its remaining aircraft to the Spanish Air Force . The British military presence in Gibraltar was formally ended in 1992 with the deactivation of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment and the Royal Gibraltar Police , and the Royal Navy sold their remaining ships in 1993 . In 1994 , the British government withdrew the right of British citizens to settle in Gibraltar . The last Royal Navy ship left in 1998 , leaving Gibraltar with no British military presence.

 Today , the British Government maintains a Foreign and Commonwealth Office presence in Gibraltar , and the British Crown maintains the Governor of Gibraltar .

### British military presence

The military history of Gibraltar began in 1704 , when the British took control of the town from Spain . The British continued to hold Gibraltar until 1713 , when Spain ceded the territory back to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht .

During the 18th century , Gibraltar became an important base for the Royal Navy , and was used as a naval base by the British during the American War of Independence . In 1779 , Gibraltar was besieged by a French and Spanish army for 11 months , but the British were able to hold out against the attackers .

In 1800 , Gibraltar was captured by the French under Marshal Joachim Murat , but the British were able to recapture the town the following year . During the Napoleonic Wars , Gibraltar became a major base for the Royal Navy .

In 1830 , the British Government established the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , which remains the only British regiment based outside the United Kingdom . In 1969 , the regiment was designated as the 1st Battalion , Royal Gibraltar Regiment , and in 1992 , the regiment was deactivated .

During World War I , Gibraltar was a major naval base for the Royal Navy , and the British Army set up a base there as well . In 1918 , the Germ

The attacks on Gibraltar were of a different nature to the attacks on Malta , which were almost entirely aerial in nature. The attacks on Gibraltar were conducted by conventional aircraft , which were able to land and take off from airfields in Spain . The first attacks on Gibraltar began in January 1940 , when Italian aircraft attacked shipping in the Mediterranean and Gibraltar. The first major attack was on 25 January 1941 , when 12 Italian aircraft attacked Gibraltar and its port facilities . The attack on Gibraltar continued with attacks by both the Italian Air Force and the Italian Royal Navy . The attacks on Gibraltar continued until the end of the war in Europe , although the frequency of attacks declined after the fall of Malta .
During the course of the war , the fortress of Gibraltar was attacked 162 times . The attacks resulted in the loss of three ships and the loss of 32 aircraft. The attacks on Gibraltar resulted in the loss of a total of 1,015 lives .

### German and Italian prisoners

During the occupation of Gibraltar, thousands of German and Italian prisoners of war were held in the Rock. The majority of these were housed in the tunnels and caverns of the Rock. In the Second World War, 4,300 German and 1,400 Italian POWs were held in Gibraltar. After the war, an additional 10,000 German POWs were held in Gibraltar.

### Air Force

The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) also established a presence in Gibraltar. The Luftwaffe was responsible for defending German interests in the Mediterranean Sea. The Luftwaffe's main base in Gibraltar was RAF Gibraltar.

### The Spanish civil war

The Spanish Civil War was a major cause of the German occupation of Gibraltar. The German government had been supporting the Nationalists in Spain since the start of the war. This support included providing the Nationalists with weapons, ammunition, and military advisers.

In the summer of 1936, the German government sent a number of warships to the Spanish coast. These ships were used to transport troops and supplies to the Nationalists.

In the spring of 1937, the German government decided to send a naval squadron to Spain. The squadron consisted of four cruisers and two destroyers. The squadron was commanded by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris.

The German squadron arrived in Spain on May 10, 1937. The squadron provided support to the Nationalists during the Battle of the Corridor. The German squadron also provided support to the Nationalists during the Battle of Cape Espartel.

In September 1937, the German government decided to send a second naval squadron to Spain. The second squadron consisted of four battleships and two cruisers. The second squadron was commanded by Admiral Erich Raeder.

During World War II , Gibraltar was an important outpost of the British Empire . The forts and tunnels at Gibraltar were a significant strategic asset to the British, who used them to store war materials and as a refuelling stop for aircraft.

However , the British Government was concerned about the safety of these evacuees and in October 1940 , a convoy was despatched to bring them back to Gibraltar .

## The evacuation

In early 1940 , the threat of war in Europe was becoming real . In Gibraltar , evacuation plans were put into place and on 26 March 1940 , 1000 people were evacuated from the Rock to the United Kingdom . The next evacuation took place on 27 March 1940 , when 250 more people were sent to the United Kingdom . The evacuations continued until the 27th April 1940 , when 300 more were sent to the United Kingdom .

## The evacuees

In the evacuations , the majority of evacuees were women and children . Most of the evacuees were from working class families . However , some evacuees were from families of Royal Navy ratings , civil servants , policemen , teachers , and even an evacuee who was a Gibraltarian artist .

### Gibraltarian artist

The artist , Frank Moreno , was an evacuee . He was born in Gibraltar in 1910 . His father was a civil servant and he was brought up in Gibraltar . In 1936 , he moved to England to work for the British Ministry of Information . In 1939 , he was called up for war service and was stationed in Gibraltar . He was evacuated to the United Kingdom in 1940 . In 1943 , he was appointed an official war artist . He was commissioned to paint a number of war related subjects , including the evacuation of Gibraltar in 1940 . In 1943 , he was commissioned to paint a series of 12 paintings depicting the evacuation of Gibraltar . The paintings were entitled 'The Evacuation of Gibraltar 1940

The French Navy did not take part in the evacuation . They were busy with their own operations in the Mediterranean , and the British Government had forbidden them to take part in the evacuation of Dunkirk . In the event , they were in no position to take part in any action at Dunkirk , because they had been heavily defeated by the Germans in the Battle of France , and were in no position to take part in any action at sea .
The evacuation of Dunkirk was the last of the great evacuations of the Second World War . The first was the evacuation of Gallipoli , in which 100,000 British and Australian troops were evacuated from the beaches of Turkey . The second was the evacuation of Crete , in which 23,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers were evacuated from the island of Crete . The third was the evacuation of the beaches of Dunkirk .

Brown's action was the more remarkable because , though he was not a member of the Cabinet , he was a member of the small National Government Committee for the Co-ordination of Defence , which met once a week in the Cabinet Room , and had the power to veto any policy put forward by the Cabinet . It is possible that he was moved by the distressing accounts which had come to him from the East End , where the effects of the Blitz were being felt in the poorer areas . At any rate he decided that a large number of civilians should be evacuated from London . He also decided that they should be placed in the care of the Ministry of Health , and not of the Ministry of Home Security . The Home Security Minister , Herbert Morrison , had made it clear that he did not wish to accept responsibility for the evacuation . Morrison's task was to organise the defence of London , and he was anxious that his Ministry should not be encumbered with the evacuees . Brown's decision was to place the evacuees in the hands of the Ministry of Health , and to give the Minister of Health , Ernest Brown , full responsibility for their welfare . Brown's action was not without precedent . In the First World War the Ministry of Health had been responsible for the care of all the civilians evacuated from London , and had been given the task of finding accommodation for them .

Jones .

### Evacuation to Jamaica

By 1940 , the threat of war with Germany had been in the air for some time , and Gibraltar had already been evacuated in 1939 , when the Axis powers had attacked Poland . In the months which followed the outbreak of war , the British Government had been taking measures to ensure that the civilian population would be able to face a war , without too much disruption , and the establishment of an emergency committee in Gibraltar was one of these measures . This committee was responsible for the preparations which were made in case of war , and in the event of an invasion of the Rock . However , in the autumn of 1940 , it was decided that the civilian population should be evacuated once more , and the committee was disbanded . 

 The idea of evacuating the Gibraltarians to the West Indies was not new , since the possibility of evacuating the civilian population of Gibraltar to Jamaica had been mooted in the past , in 1939 , and the Government had even appointed a commission to investigate the possibility of evacuating the civilian population of Gibraltar to Jamaica . The commission had arrived at the conclusion that the evacuation was impractical , but in 1940 , the threat of war had been imminent , and the Government had decided that the evacuation of the Gibraltarians was necessary . 

 The first batch of evacuees left Gibraltar on 24 October , aboard the hospital ship

### The final stages

The final stages of the evacuation were from 1941 to 1944 , when it became clear that the German army was advancing in North Africa and that evacuees would no longer be safe there . The British Government decided to send a party direct to South Africa , and 1 @,@ 000 evacuees left for South Africa direct , on 12 June 1941 . The evacuees were billeted in the Cape and Natal , and the final group left for South Africa on 17 March 1944 .

The evacuation was officially ended on 17 March 1944 , but the last group of evacuees did not leave the country until 20 May 1944 .

Ьefore the attack , the Royal Navy had been ordered to take the German Mediterranean Fleet out of action , and the German battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were sunk off the French coast by a British task force led by Admiral Somerville .
After the British conquest of the Rock , the German government would be forced to seek an armistice , leaving the Allies in control of the Mediterranean and of Gibraltar . Germany's capacity to supply its Axis partners in the Balkans , Turkey and the USSR would be seriously compromised .
Gibraltar was considered a very difficult target to defend against the German attacks . The British were at a disadvantage in that they had to rely on the Royal Air Force to defend the Rock , and the RAF's airfields were on the other side of the Strait . To put this in context , the Royal Air Force was then under the command of Air Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding . He had already been forced to cope with the Luftwaffe's campaign against England and the Royal Navy's campaign against the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau .
The Rock was defended by 2400 men , most of whom were Royal Artillery . In addition , 5000 troops were stationed in Gibraltar under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Eastwood . The total number of men defending the Rock was therefore 7400 . The Royal Artillery defended the northern side of the Rock with 18 3-inch guns and 3 12-pounder guns . The 3-inch guns were old weapons from the First World War , and their range was only 7500 yards . The 12-pounders were obsolete weapons with a range of 4000 yards .

## Background

### Military occupation of France

The German occupation of France in May 1940 was followed by the establishment of the Military Administration in France (Militärverwaltung in Frankreich) and the reorganisation of the German Army into the Wehrmacht .

In June 1940 the German Army Group B in the west, commanded by General of Panzer Troops Fedor von Bock , was reorganised into Army Group D , under the command of General of Panzer Troops Heinz Guderian .

Army Group D was responsible for the occupation of the north and west of France, with the exception of the Pas-de-Calais , which was occupied by Army Group A .

### Operation Sealion

Further information: Operation Sealion

In September 1940, Hitler decided to invade Britain , a plan that was known as Operation Sealion .

The Germans had initially planned to launch the invasion in June 1940, but this had been delayed by the reorganisation of the German Army.

The original plan had been for the Kriegsmarine to attack the Royal Navy in the English Channel, allowing the invasion fleet to reach British shores undetected.

However, the German Navy was not ready for the invasion and the German Army was still reorganising, so Hitler postponed the invasion.

### Gibraltar

Gibraltar , on the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula, was the last major Allied base in the Mediterranean and was a vital strategic asset to the British war effort.

The Rock of Gibraltar , a 426-metre (1,398 ft) high limestone promontory, dominated the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea .

Gibraltar had been under British control since 1713 and was held by the British as a strategic naval base and coaling station .

### Gibraltar Defences

Gibraltar was defended by the Gibraltar Regiment , which had a strength of 4,

The attack was to be launched from the east, west, and north. The first wave of attackers would move toward the Kremlin on the night of 20-21 December 1941, when the moon was at its highest, and the second wave would attack the following night. The plan called for the first wave to eliminate the defenses at the Kremlin and to capture the city of Moscow. The second wave would attack the Soviet command center in the Kremlin, and destroy the headquarters. The Germans would then be able to deploy their forces to the north and west.

 n the German Army , the Abwehr was subordinate to the Chief of the Army General Staff , Franz Halder . Halder had been the head of the German military intelligence in the 1930s and was very close to his superior , Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel , who was the chief of the OKW ( Oberkommando der Wehrmacht , Supreme Command of the Armed Forces ) , the highest military authority in Germany . Halder's chief of staff , Lieutenant General Friedrich Fromm , was also a close associate of Keitel and the head of the Abwehr's rival , the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ) , Reinhard Heydrich , which was a subordinate of Heinrich Himmler , the head of the SS . Halder , Fromm and Heydrich were the three most powerful men in the German military intelligence system . Halder , who was the senior officer of the three , had the power to decide which intelligence agency would be tasked with a particular mission . This would normally be the Abwehr , although the SD and the Geheime Staatspolizei ( Gestapo ) would be tasked with some missions . In the later stages of the war , the Abwehr was heavily involved in operations in the Soviet Union and North Africa . The Abwehr was responsible for intelligence gathering and operations in the Balkans , France , Scandinavia , and the Soviet Union . In 1941 , the Abwehr was tasked with the creation of the "Ratline" network , which was used to transfer Nazi war criminals to South America . By the end of the war , the Abwehr had established a network of spies and informants in the United States , Canada , Great Britain and the Soviet Union . The Abwehr was also responsible for the use of sabotage operations and intelligence-gathering in enemy territory . In the final stages of the war , the Abwehr was heavily involved in Operation Werwolf , which was a German guerrilla movement in the event of an Allied invasion of the German homeland . The Abwehr was also responsible for the use of "human intelligence" , which was the recruitment of spies and informants in enemy territory . During the war , the Abwehr had the most extensive human intelligence network of all the German intelligence agencies . The Abwehr also had the most extensive network of spies in the Soviet Union .

### The Allied invasion of Sicily

As the Allied invasion of Sicily approached , the Abwehr decided to use Calvo's network to delay the invasion . Calvo's agents were ordered to blow up the Messina Bridge and the harbour at Palermo . These orders were given to the agent who had blown up the ammunition dump at Gibraltar , who was now in charge of the operation . This agent was unaware that his superiors in the Abwehr had received information about the impending Allied invasion of Sicily . The agent was given the false impression that the Allied invasion of Sicily was a deception .

On 9 July 1943 , the agent and his team blew up the Messina Bridge and the harbour at Palermo . The explosion of the Messina Bridge was not a complete success , but the explosion at Palermo was more successful . The explosion caused a large fire at the harbour and destroyed some of the harbour facilities . The agent and his team were then arrested by the Italian authorities .

The agent who blew up the Messina Bridge was later shot by a firing squad . The other agents were interned in prison camps .

### The Allied invasion of Italy

As the Allied invasion of Italy approached , the Abwehr decided to use Calvo's network to disrupt the Allied invasion . Calvo's agents were ordered to blow up a petrol depot at Naples , and a power station at Salerno . These orders were given to the agent who had blown up the ammunition dump at Gibraltar , who was now in charge of the operation . This agent was unaware that his superiors in the Abwehr had received information about the impending Allied invasion of Italy . The agent was given the false impression that the Allied invasion of Italy was a deception .

 The island of Malta was a key strategic location for the British to monitor the Mediterranean and the team was given permission to build a post there . The post was built under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Geoffrey Baillie .

 This post was eventually captured by the Germans in 1942 . 

 They also had a secret post on Crete which was also captured by the Germans . 

 The team also built a submarine detection post in Gibraltar and a radar station on Cyprus . 

 The team were also involved in the building of an underwater base for submarines in Malta .

## World War II

In 1943 the team was transferred to the war effort and they built a number of radar stations in the UK .

 They also built an underground observation post in the Dorset countryside .

 The team were involved in the design and construction of an underwater observation post in the Thames Estuary .

The first recruit was a man called Richard Buckley . Buckley was a member of the crew of the _Terror_ , Scott’s flagship . He had been chosen by Levick to be the leader of the party that would spend the winter in the icebound ship . Buckley was a gentle , unassuming , and modest man . He had been born in 1883 in Barnes , southwest London . His father was a doctor and his mother was the daughter of a clergyman . Buckley was educated at Eton and then at the University of Oxford . He became an explorer because of his interest in geography and science and had a great enthusiasm for the Arctic . He was a member of Scott’s last expedition and his diary was published by the Royal Geographical Society . He was one of the few survivors of the tragedy and was the first person to reach the South Pole . After the expedition , Buckley became a teacher and then a lecturer at the University of Oxford . He died in 1950 . Buckley was followed by a number of other volunteers . All of them were either members of the crew of the _Terror_ or were connected in some way to the expedition . In the end , Levick had his team . The men were taken to an undisclosed location in the English countryside and given a briefing .

Cooper was born in 1921 in Yorkshire and studied medicine at Cambridge University . He joined the RNVR in 1940 and volunteered for the newly formed SBS ( Special Boat Squadron ) . After completing his training in 1942 he was posted to Gibraltar and immediately involved in Operation Tracer .
The SBS was formed in 1940 under the direct command of Admiral Sir Roger Keyes , a highly decorated officer who had earned the Victoria Cross in 1918 for his role in the capture of the German-held Turkish fortress at Gallipoli . Keyes , now a Vice-Admiral , was appointed Director of Combined Operations , and he set up the Special Boat Squadron . The squadron was formed from members of the Special Boat Service and the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve . It was a commando unit , trained in all forms of amphibious warfare , and was equipped with fast motorboats . Its primary role was to launch surprise attacks on enemy coastal defences .
The SBS was a very secret organisation , and its existence was not known to the public until 1942 . The commandos , who were the forerunners of the SBS , were formed in 1940 by Major General J. E. L. Laycock , who had served with distinction in the First World War . The commandos were small units of men who were trained in various forms of warfare , including amphibious assaults and raids on enemy coastal defences . They were often used to carry out dangerous missions , such as the raid on the French coast at Dieppe in 1942 .

### Naval Warfare

The British had an advantage in the Mediterranean due to the location of Gibraltar at the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea . The British Navy was able to intercept most of the U @-@ boats in the Strait of Gibraltar . The Germans never had a chance to develop a plan of attacking Gibraltar . The U @-@ boats were also forced to negotiate the Strait of Gibraltar and were easily detected by British aircraft .

### Allied Shipping

The British had the advantage in the Mediterranean due to the Allied shipping convoys that were able to pass through the Mediterranean Sea . The British were able to defend these convoys with their aircraft carriers and other warships . The Germans were unable to destroy these convoys due to the ineffective tactics of the U @-@ boats .

### Submarines

The Germans also had a submarine campaign in the Mediterranean during the same time period . The German submarines were able to inflict more damage on the Allied shipping than the U @-@ boats . The U @-@ boats were unable to attack the Allied shipping convoys because of the ineffective tactics of the U @-@ boats .

### Bombing Campaigns

The Germans were able to bomb Malta and Gibraltar , but this did not affect the Allied shipping . The Allies were able to use the Gibraltar bombings to develop their defenses .

### Conclusion

The Allies were able to defeat the U @-@ boat campaign in the Mediterranean Sea . The U @-@ boats were unable to destroy the Allied shipping convoys and were unable to attack Gibraltar .

> of the most remarkable examples of the necessity of flexibility in planning is to be found in the development of the plan for the invasion of North Africa . <unk> . The plan was originally prepared in 1940 for a landing on the north coast of Africa . It was based on the premise that the United Kingdom would be able to support the expedition and would be able to land it. The plan was then used for the purposes of training and experimentation in the United Kingdom . In the meantime the situation in North Africa had changed . <unk> . The British army in that area was considerably reinforced and the United Kingdom was no longer in a position to support the expedition . The plan had to be changed . It was then transferred to the United States , and an American force was prepared to land in North Africa . The plan for the landing was then changed again . It was necessary to take into account the possibility that the German air force might be able to make an effective defense of the landing area . The plan therefore provided for the seizure of airfields in advance of the landing and for the use of these airfields for air support of the landing . This plan was then found to be impractical because the German air force was not capable of mounting a serious defense of the landing area . In consequence , the plan was changed again . The seizure of the airfields was abandoned and it was decided to use the airfields as they were . This plan , which was in effect , is the plan which was executed . 

It was inevitable that the plan should be changed several times . The original plan was based on the assumption that the United Kingdom would be able to support the expedition . This assumption was not valid . It was necessary to abandon the plan and to make a new plan . This new plan was based on the assumption that the United Kingdom was unable to support the expedition . This assumption was not valid . The plan was then changed again . The changes were necessary because of the unforeseen developments of the war . The plan was changed several times because of these unforeseen developments . <unk> . 

The foregoing example illustrates the necessity for flexibility in planning . The plan was originally based on the assumption that the United Kingdom would be able to support the expedition . When this assumption proved to be invalid , the plan had to be changed . In order to be flexible , it was necessary to change the plan several times .

> funds and the Resettlement Board , which had been established in November 1943 , had to do something about this . The Board had been given the task of arranging for the repatriation of evacuees who were not British subjects , but were not otherwise entitled to the protection of the British Government . The evacuees were to be repatriated as soon as possible after the war , but were not to be sent back to a country in which they would be subject to harsh treatment . In January 1944 , the Board had received a letter from the Adviser on Evacuation , Lord Cranborne , asking that the Board should try to ensure that the evacuees should not lose their money , and that they should receive some compensation for the loss of their businesses and other property . 

In March 1944 , the Board set up a working party to investigate the possibility of compensation for the evacuees , and the working party reported in May 1944 . The report was not considered by the Board until August 1944 , and on 12 October 1944 , the Board , in consultation with the Government of Portugal , established a scheme of compensation for the evacuees . The scheme provided for a lump sum payment of £100 for each evacuee , and a monthly allowance of £10 until the evacuee’s return to his own country . The scheme was not based on any detailed investigation of the losses suffered by the evacuees , but it was based on the assumption that they had suffered a loss of £100 . The scheme was to be administered by the Resettlement Board , but the Board agreed to delegate this responsibility to the Adviser on Evacuation , Lord Cranborne . 

The first payments under the scheme were made on 21 October 1944 , and by the end of 1944 , 4,000 evacuees had received payments . However , the scheme did not cover all evacuees , and in November 1944 , the Resettlement Board considered the question of compensation for evacuees who were not covered by the scheme .

 Vespasian 's and Titus 's rise to power was initially not a smooth one , as the Roman Senate refused to accept the emperors and declared Galba as the new ruler of the Roman Empire . Vespasian and Titus were forced to wait for an opportunity to challenge the Senate 's decision , which came when Vespasian 's legions , stationed in Egypt , declared him emperor on 1 December 69 . This announcement prompted the legions of the Rhine and Danube to recognize Vespasian as emperor and force Galba to commit suicide .

### Conquest of Judea

Main article: Jewish Revolt

The Jewish Revolt against Rome , which erupted in 66 CE, had a profound effect on the course of the Roman Empire. During the first half of the revolt, Vespasian and his son Titus were the Roman commanders of the war in Judea .

Vespasian and Titus were given the task of ending the Jewish revolt , and were given the task of quelling the rebellion . They met with success in the first year of the revolt , and were able to capture the Galilee region and besiege the Jewish stronghold of Yodfat (Jotapata) .

After capturing Yodfat, Vespasian and Titus moved on to the Jewish capital of Jerusalem . Although the Roman legions were able to capture the city, the Jews put up fierce resistance and the city was eventually razed to the ground. The Romans then built a new city, Aelia Capitolina, on the ruins of Jerusalem.

In 69, Vespasian was declared emperor by the Roman legions in Egypt and was able to return to Rome and take power . Titus remained in Judea and completed the conquest of the region . He was able to capture the Jewish stronghold of Masada in 73 .

## Biography

Nerva was the son of Marcus Cocceius Nerva and Domitia Luna . His father was a senator and had been consul in 52 . His mother was the sister of Titus Flavius Sabinus , the father of Vespasian . Nerva was the grandfather of the future emperor Trajan , and the father-in-law of Pliny the Elder .

### Family

Nerva's son-in-law was Titus Flavius Sabinus , a wealthy senator and consul in 77 . The Flavians had been in decline for many years , and the deaths of Sabinus and Nerva's son Cocceius Nerva , who had been consul in 88 , had left the family with no one to carry on the name . This meant that the Flavians were no longer able to compete with the more prominent families in the Roman aristocracy , and the Flavians were no longer able to produce emperors .

### Early career

Nerva was consul in 71 . This was a remarkable achievement for someone who had never held a consulship before . His career was at this point blocked by the fact that he was the brother-in-law of the emperor Otho , who had been elected emperor on 15 January 69 .

### Vespasian and Domitian

In 71 , he was awarded the suffect consulship for the months of October and November . Nerva was then appointed as one of the legates of the Roman army stationed in Germania . The emperor Vespasian appointed Nerva as his praetorian prefect on 17 December 71 . In 74 , he was appointed as the governor of Germania Superior .

### Nerva's consulship

Main article: Consul of the Roman Empire § Nerva (97)

Nerva's consulship was from 1 January to 31 May 97 . Nerva's consulship was a novendialis , the term used to describe the shortest possible term for a consulship . This was probably because Nerva was only consul for five days and needed to be back in Rome to attend the Senate .

### Military campaigns

Domitian's first military campaigns of the year were against the Chatti in Germania Superior , the first major offensive of his reign . He also led a campaign against the Catti in Germania Inferior . The campaigns were successful and the Chatti and Catti were defeated . After returning to Rome , Domitian was presented with a golden crown .

### Political reforms

Domitian's first political reform was a new constitution for the Roman army . The constitution was likely designed to increase the loyalty of the army to Domitian .

The new constitution introduced two new offices : the duumviri peregrini and the duumviri iure dicundo . The duumviri peregrini were two military tribunes , who were responsible for recruiting foreign troops . These recruits were likely to have been slaves and were known as "peregrini" because they were foreigners . The duumviri iure dicundo were two military tribunes who were responsible for the courts martial of soldiers . This reform was likely designed to increase the loyalty of the army to Domitian .

Domitian also introduced a law which declared that the emperor could not be killed by his soldiers . This law was likely designed to increase the loyalty of the army to Domitian .

### Judicial reforms

Domitian's first judicial reform was the introduction of the duumviri iudicandi . These were two military tribunes who were responsible for the courts martial of soldiers . This reform was likely designed to increase the loyalty of the army to Domitian .

> ents and moderns to speculate that he was chosen by the plotters as a figurehead to be easily replaced . Nerva was succeeded in turn by Trajan , Hadrian , Antoninus Pius , and Marcus Aurelius . Nerva’s reign , however , introduced a new principle of empire . He declined to claim the title of Augustus , which had been reserved for the founder of the principate , Augustus . Instead , he adopted the title of princeps (the traditional title of the Roman leader , especially in times of crisis , and which had been revived by Augustus as the title of his chosen successor) and adopted the name of Nerva Trajanus Optimus Pius . This name was chosen to reflect the fact that Nerva was the first emperor to adopt a new name on accession since Augustus . Nerva adopted this name to indicate his intention to rule in the manner of the “best” of the emperors , Augustus , and to distance himself from the ruthless policies of Domitian . This practice , however , was to be continued by the later emperors . In 98 , Nerva adopted Trajan as his heir . This was the first time that the succession had been formally adopted , although it was not unprecedented . In 69 , Galba had adopted Piso as his heir , and he in turn had adopted Otho . The adoption of Trajan , however , was the first time that an heir was adopted while still living . Trajan was the first emperor to be officially adopted as a son by the emperor who adopted him . Nerva’s rule was marked by a general restoration of the Republic , which had been effectively abolished by Augustus . This process was reversed under Nerva , who sought to make the emperor a mere first citizen among his subjects . In a significant step , Nerva appointed members of the Senate to his consulships . Although he had not been elected to the post , he was appointed consul for the first time on 1 January 97 . He held the consulship again in 98 and 99 . His choice of consuls reflected his commitment to restoring the Republic . The first consul was Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus , the king of the Regni (southern Britain) . The second was Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus , the

In the meantime , the Emperor’s assassins were nowhere to be found , and Nerva was too weak to take action against them . In addition , the Senate was too terrified of the Praetorian Guard to interfere .

 Nerva’s reign was marked by a return to the principles of the Julio-Claudian dynasty , and the Senate was reinstated as the governing body of the Empire . He also expanded the Senate by creating new senatorial provinces and adding to the number of senators . He restored the powers of the Senate , which had been severely diminished under the Flavians , and he made it clear that he would not meddle in senatorial affairs . He did not like the Senate , and was often absent from Rome . He was a philosopher and an intellectual , and he was not interested in the political affairs of the Empire . 

 His reign was also noted for its political and social tolerance , and for the end of the persecution of Christians . Nerva’s most notable achievement was the introduction of the system of adoptive succession , which was a method of selecting new Emperors who would be in control of the Army and the Senate , rather than the Praetorian Guard . He adopted Trajan as his heir , and he was the first Emperor to adopt an heir . In a short time , Nerva was able to re-establish stability in the Empire . 

## Early life

 Nerva also undertook to restore the lost territories of the Roman Republic . His first campaign was against the Germanic tribes who had defeated the armies of Germanicus and Tiberius in the Rhine region . This campaign , in which Nerva was personally involved , was successful and led to the restoration of the Roman province of Germania Inferior . 

 The next campaign of Nerva was against the Parthian Empire , which had been the cause of the death of Nero and which had been the object of repeated invasions by the Roman Empire . In 92 , Nerva launched a campaign against the Parthians . The main target of this campaign was the city of Susa , which was the seat of the Parthian king . The siege of Susa was successful and led to the restoration of the Roman province of Mesopotamia . 

 The last campaign of Nerva was against the kingdom of Dacia . This campaign was provoked by the murder of the Roman governor of Dacia by the king of that country .

### Domitian

Aureus of Domitian

On the death of Nerva, Domitian succeeded him as emperor . The young emperor was a great admirer of Nerva, and his early acts of government were intended to please the man whom he regarded as his teacher .

However , the adulation of Nerva was to be short-lived . Domitian's first act was to remove the bust of Nerva from the Senate House and replace it with his own . He also ordered the removal of Nerva's name from the coinage .

The historian Tacitus described Domitian as "a mere tool in the hands of the Senate" , and the senators used Nerva's name to embarrass Domitian .

In 87 AD , Domitian was forced to release the freedmen of Nerva from their obligations , and in 93 AD he was forced to restore the title of Nerva to the Senate .

In 97 AD , Domitian ordered the removal of Nerva's bust from the Forum , and replaced it with his own . In 98 AD , Domitian ordered the removal of the bust of Nerva from the Temple of the Divine Claudius , and replaced it with his own .

## Domestic policy

### Government

Nerva withdrew from the Senate and the public assemblies, preferring to devote himself to his private affairs. His reign was marked by the political power of the Praetorian Guard, which had been enlarged by Domitian and was now headed by the equestrian prefect Cornelius Palma. 

The emperor had to deal with a large number of provincial revolts. In 98, a revolt of the Batavi, a Germanic tribe living in the Roman province of Germania Inferior, was quelled by a Roman army led by the future emperor Trajan. A second revolt in 99, this time by the Bructeri, was ended by the governor Lucius Neratius Marcellus.

In 97, the emperor instituted the Judicium de viribus, which was a physical examination of all potential candidates for the consulship. The examination included a series of physical exercises, and the examination was repeated every year.

### Economy

Nerva's coins were minted in all mints of the empire, but the majority of them were minted in Rome. Nerva's coinage was very similar to that of Domitian. Nerva's coins featured a bust of the emperor on the obverse and a reverse depicting a nude figure, usually a seated female, but sometimes a seated male.

Nerva's coinage was similar to that of Domitian.

### Religion

Nerva was a man of pious temperament, but he did not make the worship of the traditional gods a priority. He did not intervene in the religious controversies of his time, and he did not introduce any new gods into the imperial cult.

### Military

Nerva's reign was marked by a series of military campaigns. In 97, the emperor dispatched a Roman army led by the future emperor Trajan against the Ch

 In his final years , Domitian became increasingly paranoid and authoritarian . He executed many of his advisors and soldiers , and he built the Domus Flavia , a vast palace on the Palatine Hill .

### Suppression

Nerva's army in the north , led by General Quintus Petillius Cerialis , was able to suppress the Praetorian Guard and return Nerva to Rome . The Senate ordered the execution of Casperius Aelianus and 20 other senior Praetorians . 

## Aftermath

The Praetorian Guard was disbanded and replaced by a new cohort of soldiers recruited from the colonies of the Empire . The new Praetorian Guard remained in service under Nerva and his successor , Trajan .

This was widely perceived as a sign that he would not be as harsh as Domitian had been , and the Senate began to reassert its own influence . During the same year , Nerva had agreed to give away his daughter to the son of Emperor Titus , Domitian 's father . This was a political gesture that Nerva was later to regret , as Titus ' son , Titus Flavius Domitianus , would become his successor . The adoption of the younger Domitian in 89 would be the most significant of Nerva 's political acts , and its consequences would continue to affect the Roman Empire for years to come .

 Nerva 's reign was marked by a continuation of the persecution of the Christians , and the rise of the Roman Empire 's first Christian martyrs . He died on 27 January 98 , the last of the Five Good Emperors , and was succeeded by his adoptive son , Domitian .

## Early life

Nerva was born in Hispania Tarraconensis , the son of a Roman senator of equestrian rank named Silvius . He was born in the town of Sisapo in the province of Baetica , but his family later moved to Narbo (modern Narbonne ) in Gaul . His father died when he was still young, and he was adopted by his uncle , who was a senator .

## Career before becoming emperor

Nerva served as a military tribune in the Roman army in Germany . After his military service , he became a member of the Senate . He was appointed to the governorship of Germania Inferior , which he held from 62 to 64 . In 66 , he was appointed governor of Syria .

 The Senate did not want Marcellus as emperor , and instead proposed the consul Gaius Traianus , who was popular among the common people .  The Senate also decided that Nerva's heir should be Trajan , who was a distant relative of Nerva through his mother .  The Senate then passed a decree that Nerva should adopt Trajan as his heir . 

 Nerva agreed to the Senate's demands , and Trajan was adopted by Nerva on 28 September 97 .

 normal practice , Trajan was not adopted by Nerva's father , but by Nerva himself , who adopted Trajan as his son and heir . 

 After Nerva's death in 98 , Trajan became the sole emperor , and a new dynasty was founded . 

 Trajan was born in Italica , a Roman colony in the province of Hispania Baetica (in modern-day Spain) around 53 . His father was Marcius Turbo , who was from Italica , and his mother was Prisca . Trajan was related to the gens Acilia , and his family had been in Hispania for several generations . His family was of equestrian rank , and he had at least one brother , named Marcus Ulpius Traianus . 

### Youth and early career

Trajan's early life is obscure , although he may have been born in Rome . He was a member of the equestrian order , and was employed as a financial official under Domitian . In 89 , he married Pompeia Plotina , who was a great-granddaughter of the emperor Vespasian . He was a friend of Pliny the Younger , and the two men corresponded . 

 He served in the Roman military in Germania and Dalmatia . 

 He also served as a legate of Legio II Adiutrix in Pannonia , where he led a campaign against the Marcomanni . His efforts in this war were recorded by the historian Cassius Dio . 

### Reign

Trajan was proclaimed emperor on 8 September 98 . His succession was opposed by the Praetorian Guard , who had been disbanded by Domitian . In the chaos that followed , Trajan was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers , but he was not acclaimed by the Senate until 10 March 99 . 

 He restored the Senate to its former power , and the members were allowed to interfere in the government . 

 He was a popular emperor , and he was regarded as the first of the Five Good Emperors . 

 Trajan was also the first emperor to have been born outside Italy .

4 The Rise of Hadrian and the Settlement of the Julio-Claudian Succession
The accession of Trajan in 98 AD marked the end of the Nerva-Antonine era . Despite his recent accession , Trajan was an old man when he came to power , and he died less than two years later . The Roman Senate , however , chose to ignore Trajan's short reign and to view his successor , Hadrian , as the legitimate successor of the Five Good Emperors . Hadrian , however , had no connection with the Nerva-Antonine era . A native of Hispania Baetica , he had no connections with the nobility of Rome . He was the first emperor to come from outside of Italy and the first to be a Spaniard . In addition , his reign of twenty-one years marked the longest interruption of the Julio-Claudian succession since the death of Augustus .
Hadrian's accession to power marked the beginning of a new era in Roman history . Hadrian is often considered to be the first truly " Roman " emperor , and his reign is marked by a renewed emphasis on the traditional values of the Republic . Unlike his predecessors , Hadrian was not a military leader . Instead , he was an intellectual and a scholar . Hadrian's reign was marked by a series of military campaigns , but they were more about extending the frontiers of the empire than about conquering new territory . In fact , he was more concerned with fortifying the empire than he was with expanding it .
Hadrian's reign is also marked by the construction of many monuments . Among these were the Pantheon and the Baths of Caracalla . These monuments were built to commemorate his reign and to enhance the prestige of the emperor .
Hadrian's reign also saw the beginning of the Christian persecutions . In 117 AD , he issued the Antonine Constitution , which made Christianity a legal religion . This was a significant step in the development of Christianity , as it allowed Christians to practice their religion without fear of persecution .

 Nerva's legacy is considered to have been the improvement of the imperial system .

This stability was reflected in the peaceful accession of Trajan and the subsequent accession of Hadrian .

The reign of Nerva was marked by a series of military campaigns in the Roman provinces of Germania , Dacia , and Arabia , and a consolidation of the empire 's frontiers . During Nerva 's reign , the Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent in history , stretching from the Euphrates in the east to the Atlantic in the west . Nerva also instituted several major reforms , including the creation of the Praetorian Guard , the establishment of a formal relationship between the Roman Senate and the Roman Emperors , and the introduction of a system of government by 'twin consuls ' (consuls ordinarii ).

The Year of the Five Emperors was a period of instability in the Roman Empire in 69 AD, when five different individuals held the title of Roman Emperor. It is generally regarded as one of the most turbulent periods in Roman history.

The Year of the Five Emperors began when Galba, a wealthy and influential senator, was proclaimed Emperor by the Praetorian Guard on the death of Nero in 68 AD. Galba was one of several senators who had been involved in the Pisonian conspiracy against Nero, and the Praetorian Guard, who had been involved in the Pisonian conspiracy, had been accused of murdering Nero. Galba was widely unpopular among the Roman people, and was killed by his own Praetorian Guard in January 69 AD.

### Succession crisis

Main article: Year of the Four Emperors

The Year of the Four Emperors

The accession of Nerva in 96 was the result of a long succession crisis that began with the death of Domitian in September 96 . The imperial throne was vacant for three months until Nerva, who was considered to be the most suitable man for the job, was adopted by the Praetorian Guard and recognized as Emperor on 18 December .

### Fiscal reforms

Nerva's first concern as emperor was to stabilize the economy . The government was deeply in debt to private banks , and the debt was rising. Nerva immediately established a commission to investigate the problem, and in 97 he enacted a law limiting interest rates and making it more difficult for debtors to be imprisoned for defaulting on their debts .

The debt problem was not solved by these measures , and Nerva instituted further reforms in 98 . He ordered the government to pay off its debts to the private banks , and he also ordered the minting of large quantities of new coins to replace the debased coinage that had been issued under Domitian . Nerva's coins were of higher quality , and they circulated more widely than those of previous emperors .

Nerva's fiscal reforms helped to restore confidence in the economy , but they were not sufficient to solve the problem of debt . The debt problem was exacerbated by the fact that Nerva did not have the funds to pay off the debts of the government . Nerva's financial policies were therefore designed to increase government revenue . He introduced new taxes on agricultural land and on slaves , and he increased the tax on wine .

### Military reforms

Nerva's military reforms were intended to improve the efficiency of the Roman army . He ordered the army to be reorganized into smaller units , and he appointed new officers to command these units . He also increased the number of soldiers in the army , and he introduced new pay scales .

Nerva's military reforms were successful in

> owned power and prestige during the Principate , and Nerva's actions helped to strengthen the Senate's position in the Empire . His successor , Trajan , was the first of the Five Good Emperors , who were all senators , and he was the first emperor to be regarded as a member of the Senate .

## Reign

Nerva's reign was a short one , and it is not clear whether the Senate or the Praetorian Guard actually selected him to become emperor . Nerva's reign was characterized by a general peace , and the Senate and people were well pleased with his reign . He was a benevolent ruler who was characterized as a "good man " and "a just and modest prince " . He was also the first emperor to be described as "a man of the people " .

### Consecration and civil wars

The death of Domitian in 96 AD was followed by a period of civil war between the supporters of Domitian's successor , Titus , and Domitian's own family .

### Economic policies

During his reign , Nerva pursued an economic policy of moderation . He imposed a tribute on Egypt , but refrained from imposing any further taxes . He also continued the economic policies of Domitian , which had been characterized by the expansion of the imperial bureaucracy and the consolidation of the Roman Empire . He also continued to build roads , public baths , and public buildings .

### Military policies

Nerva's reign was characterized by a general peace . He continued the military policies of Domitian , which had been characterized by the expansion of the Roman Empire . During his reign , Nerva continued to conduct wars in the Roman province of Dacia , and he also conducted a war against the Chatti . He also continued the campaigns of Domitian against the Dacians , which culminated in the Battle of Tapae .

### Social policies

During his reign , Nerva promoted the interests of the senatorial class , and he also promoted the interests of the common people . He also made concessions to the common people , including the right to wear a toga . He also promoted the interests of the freedmen , and he also introduced a tax on freedmen

> ight was not helped by the fact that he was not a Roman aristocrat but a senator from the remote province of Pannonia . Murison says that , although the fact that Nerva was not a Roman aristocrat had not in itself caused problems in the past , the situation had changed and he was not in a position to appoint a man of similar background to his position . Instead he chose a man who had earned his position through military achievements and was trusted by the army . Trajan's victory in the Dacian Wars and his conquest of Mesopotamia and Armenia were considered by some to be the greatest military achievements of the early imperial era .

The emperor Trajan was a good example of a Roman aristocrat and Murison states that he was a more popular emperor than his adoptive father and more respected by the senate . The reign of Trajan was a period of expansion and conquest for the Roman Empire and his military exploits were held in high regard by the senate . The conquest of Dacia , which was considered to be a military triumph , was followed by a period of peace and prosperity . Trajan's conquest of Mesopotamia was also considered to be a military triumph and his conquest of Armenia was a success which resulted in the conquest of the Parthian Empire . The senate , Murison says , was reluctant to accept Trajan as the heir to Nerva and his accession was regarded with some apprehension . The senate's concerns were allayed when Trajan proved to be a popular emperor .

### Military campaigns

Murison states that Trajan's reign was marked by a period of expansion and conquest which was regarded by the senate as a military triumph . Trajan's conquest of Dacia , which was considered to be a military triumph , was followed by a period of peace and prosperity . The conquest of Dacia was achieved by Trajan's general L. Aelius Caesar who defeated the Dacian king Decebalus and captured his capital Sarmizegethusa . After the conquest of Dacia , Trajan's reign was marked by a period of peace and prosperity .

## Plot

Pool shark Eddie "Fast Eddie" Felson is on a winning streak in small-town pool halls, until he is humiliated by Minnesota Fats. Eddie's manager Bert Gordon convinces him to come to the Memphis, Tennessee, bar of Charlie Burns, where the biggest prize money is available.

In Memphis, Eddie meets Sarah Packard, the bar owner's daughter. Bert wants to be a part of the action, but Eddie is insulted and refuses to include him. Eddie wins the $10,000 top prize, and Bert is enraged. After the tournament, Eddie and Sarah have a romantic evening together. Bert, who is jealous, tries to have Eddie thrown out of town.

When Eddie returns to his hotel room, he finds Bert there, and the two get into a fight. Eddie wins, but Bert attacks him with a bottle. Bert is arrested, and Eddie is taken to the hospital.

Most people who have seen the movie know how the game ends. I thought it was well done, and I enjoyed it.

The movie is a little slow at times, but it's still a good movie. It's about a guy who bets his life savings on a game of cards. He wins the first game, but then he loses the next one. He has to find a way to win the next game. He has to use all of his skills to win the next game. He has to be careful, because if he loses the next game, he will lose his life savings.
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie is about a guy who is in a lot of debt and he wants to win a game of poker to pay off his debt.

### Editing

The Hustler was edited by William Ziegler . Ziegler , who had edited Rossen's previous film The Green Pastures ( 1964 ) , had a long history with the director. The Hustler was the last film on which they worked together. The film was cut in New York City , using Moviola editing equipment . Rossen had a reputation for being a difficult filmmaker , and he was known for making changes to the editing room floor while the film was being cut .

### Score

The Hustler's original score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith . Rossen was a fan of Goldsmith's work , and had worked with him on his previous film The Green Pastures . Goldsmith was also a fan of the film, and told film historian Dana Polan that he had been "dreaming" of doing the score since he saw the film in 1961. Goldsmith's score was recorded at the Paramount Scoring Stage in Hollywood on November 16 and 17 , 1961. Goldsmith and his arranger, Robert Armbruster , chose to use a 44-piece orchestra for the score, which was unusual for a film of the era. The score features a main theme that was used for the character of Minnesota Fats. Goldsmith also wrote several variations of the theme for various scenes in the film. Actor Walter Matthau later said that he thought the score was "a masterpiece" and that he thought it was "better than the picture."

### Post-production

The Hustler was originally given an "R" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America , due to the film's use of profanity and sexual situations . Rossen and producer Samuel Arkoff fought to get the film a "PG" rating, and the film was eventually re-rated in early 1962.

### Production

The film was originally titled The Pool Shark ,  but the title was changed because the film's story was not about the pool shark , but rather about the man who played against him.

The Hustler was the first film to use the sound system developed by Tomlinson Holman , who had worked on the film's sound mix with Douglas Shearer . The system, called the "Magic System", was designed to record all of the dialogue and sound effects on a separate track, thus making it possible to remix the soundtrack after the film was shot . This was a departure from the then-standard process, in which all sound was recorded simultaneously on the film soundtrack. The system was used on a number of films, including The Killing Fields , but was eventually replaced by the Dolby A system.

### Casting

Rossen wanted Paul Newman for the part of Fast Eddie, but the actor was reluctant to take the role. Newman eventually accepted the role, after Rossen told him he would not get another chance to play such a role.

Most of the pool shots in the film were shot at the Hustler Club in Hollywood , California . The film's production company also acquired the club and renamed it the "Fast Eddie's Hustler Club".

### Release

The Hustler was a financial success, grossing $26 million in the United States and Canada and $14 million overseas, for a worldwide total of $40 million.

### Critical response

The Hustler was generally well received by critics. At the time of the film's release, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the film, calling it "a strong and riveting piece of work" and "a superior drama" that "succeeds admirably in its purpose". He also noted that the film "doesn't look like an argument for pool playing" and that "it is a story about a man".

The film holds a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews, with the consensus stating: "The Hustler is an American classic about a man who has to face the consequences of his actions."

### Critical reception

In his review for The New York Times , Bosley Crowther wrote, "Newman is marvelous as the hustler and his character is so forcefully conceived and acted that he almost overshadows the other two. It is a brilliant piece of acting, and one of the most impressive performances in recent years." He added, "The story is simple and direct and is told with such intensity and realism that it is both exciting and moving. It is a marvelous movie in every respect."

In his review for the Los Angeles Times , Philip K. Scheuer wrote, "The Hustler is a most admirable film, a beautifully made, sensitively acted, crisply directed motion picture which contains not a single false note." He added, "In the end, though, the film is not a bitter indictment of society. It is a lament for the human spirit and the way it is crushed by the demands of a materialistic society."

### Accolades

The film is ranked number 16 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American movies.
