As such, understanding an ancient poem' s biographical background can help explain its meaning  ; it may also give insight into how these historical events affected individual lives or perceptions during those times  
 Wang Guowei noted a similarity to Japanese tanka poetry: while both traditions focus more heavily than Western ones do upon personal experience as reflected through one ' life experiences " ( 生活体验 ), he observed this approach was not the case for Tang dynasty court wu poems . This difference is rooted , according to Hung and Watson alike in Chinese literary theory : unlike European writers who emphasize style over substance, classical Confuc ian scholars hold that the author' s character defines his work. Thus understanding an ancient poet can reveal how they viewed their own writing or society at large  
 In some cases Du Fu has been portrayed differently by different historians: Li Bai praised him but Wang Guowei criticized both men as merely following trends; Hu Shih considered them important predecessors of modern poetry  ; while others have focused on aspects such a political agendas ( e .g , " The Southerners " ) and biography (" Life in Exile ") respectively : although most agree he was talented, Watson notes this is not universal — Hung considers the later poems from his exilic years to be inferior compared with those written earlier. This can also lead critics toward contrasting conclusions about how Du Fu's life influenced or reflected upon Chinese literature: one school believes it had little effect beyond influencing other works by him alone whereas another sees evidence suggesting otherwise

From Wikipedia, 2017: Zhang Ruoxu (Chinese :張若述; pinyin ; born May eleven ) is an Chinese language actor & model who was seen within China' s film industry since she made her debut in Beijing Film Academy at age sixteen years old through commercials and print advertisements after which moving on TV series like Qian Zheng Yi Jia(千刀一击)，Xuan-Yang Li Fei Huo Xue Ren Tong Chun Ge（玄洋雷发火雪人通春歌）.
During his lifetime, Du Fu had a really big influence not only for the poets of that time but additionally to those generations later such as Wang Wei , Bai Juyi 白居易 (723—eighty four6), Miao Shuo Zhaozhi赣州之士 and others who even added their own interpretation or commentaries on this poet's work . Moreover many artists have been influenced by him in portraying Chinese landscape paintings which is mirrored within an entire genre known because the "Furong" movement from its first name Fengguo Mountain.
Du was born right into a wealthier household than his contemporaneous poets, however he had no interest for materialistic things all through most of life until later years when it became apparent that there isn’t any money left anymore after supporting each family members since father died early whereas mother lived longer thus leaving them with out monetary help as well-known fact made clear during Du Fu ' s autobiography .

Nevertheless there were those who recognised talent among this failure: Liu Shiping 劉時平 proposed him for a post in Jiangxi , but after some delay Chai Rong  蔡榮 and others persuaded Zhang Yanyuan to take the young poet on . As was usual at that time (and later) he took his new name from its first character : Xue Tao became known by it as "Son of Water". The next year saw Hung's own entry into service ; apparently they did not meet until two years afterwards, when both worked under Wang Wei.

In the following period up to about seven hundred forty six (spring) he wrote over three thousand poems . His style was influenced greatly from that point on by Yang Su of Luoyangua man who had been recommended as his tutor ... Xue Tao's first major work is considered "The Bamboo Grove" which appeared around seventy-five. It includes such well known pieces like The Stream Flowing South, Farewell To My Friends At Home....

During this time Du Fu fell ill with tuberculosis which plagued him for many more decades to come; he had been afflicted since childhood but grew worse during these years of stressful travels around the empire , his diet not being up-to -date or balanced . 
He sought help at various times over subsequent months, trying herbal remedies as well taking on patients himself in order gain some income (though records do show a few instances where people were harmed by their treatments). After several visits from medical practitioners who could only prescribe rest cures and medicines like salt water enemas along with moxibustion therapy applied via burning pine needles close to open wounds; Du Fu eventually gave into despair when there seemed no hope left. His family tried everything they knew how but nothing worked – finally deciding that it would be best if he just stayed home until things got better naturally . 
Du Fus illness is believed may have been caused either due complications arising out of tuberculosis or even malnutrition because his diet was not balanced enough during those years spent away from Chang'an (the imperial capital). This period also saw many other events occurring around him, such as Emperor Xianzong ascending the throne after an internal struggle between various factions within court which led to civil war and famine throughout much Of China. During this time , Du Fu had lost all hope for himself ; thus

He had a good command over Chinese poetry writing style by age twenty ( he is said to have memorized all of Confucius ' works ). He became an accomplished poet himself . His first published poems appeared in the year that his father died , when they were included among those written on ceramic tiles for Emperor Su Zhi. The emperor greatly admired these verses and invited Li Bai personally into court service wherein, although never holding any high official rank or position  -he did enjoy considerable influence as part-time royal advisor(cultural minister) until 742 A D/CE
He was a very good friend with Du Fu who lived during Tang dynasty China's Golden Age (AD618 – AD905). He is considered one of four major Chinese poets from this time period . His works have been translated extensively since the early twentieth century , often appearing in anthologies such as "The New American Poetry" edited by Harold Bloom. Li Bai has also inspired many paintings and sculptures throughout history, including those produced today which are sometimes sold for millions at auction houses around Asia or Europe; however despite his great influence on art culture there remains little information available about him due to lacking records concerning life events before 742 A D/CE until shortly after death when he was buried with high honors next door beside Du Fu's grave site near Chengdu Sichuan Province (China).

> Prefecture, then moved again when appointed Clerk at Wuxing Commandery. His postings were always temporary and unstable — partisan politics resulted from constant changes among officials with different political factions vying against one another through patronage appoints based on personal relations or connections rather than any real competency; this led many people like Li Bai (李白) who had been dismissed for misconduct simply switching sides to gain favorable positions elsewhere while still retaining their previous rank so they could return whenever possible . This instability caused Du Fu' s family much hardship as he was constantly moving away without being able 
to take them along, sometimes leaving behind debts which only increased over time due lack of income. By early spring in the following year , his father died from illness brought about by poverty and neglect ; these events would greatly influence later poems such "On My Father’s Death" & “Song on a Good-for -Nothing” (逍夷賦). During this period until around age thirty when things began to improve slightly through better jobs at Changsha Commandery then Huzhou Prefecture where Du Fu spent most if not all summer months writing poetry . He also started composing ballads during winter stays 
in cities like Wuxi which were more cultured centres than rural areas providing him with greater opportunities for social interaction leading up towards his eventual appointment as Governor' s Clerk in Yuecheng County by Emperor Suzong of Tang Dynasty circa AD763-4; here he wrote many poems dedicated various officials who helped advance career prospects though none achieved similar status compared modern day stars such Wang Wei (王維).

When Tang Dynasty fell apart into separate kingdom s shortly thereafter; Wang Bo asked " Why do you remain here ? The country is lost !" but according Han Yu: 
I am just an old man living alone by myself underneath that mulberry tree / I have no business being involved with these things . All my life , all day long Du Fu had been concerned about his health and sought out places where the air was better than it would be at home ; this may explain why so many of poems are written from a variety different locations :  some describe scenes along river banks or in gardens while others take place on mountaintops. One such poem describes how he watched cranes fly overhead as they returned to their nesting grounds for winter; another depicts him sitting outside during rainy weather waiting patiently until dawn arrives when everything will become clear once again..

In these respect he resembles Japanese poet Bashō who also wrote about nature, but unlike him did not express himself using highly coloured metaphors or images that might distract from their meaning: "Du'an believed strongly as many others before her in such Buddhist concepts like impermanence (Sanskrit anitya ) . She used simple language with vivid imagery to convey the ephemeral quality she witnessed around herself." 
His work was greatly admired by Chinese poets since ancient times ; Li Bai once said of Du Fu : 'Who can rival his genius ? He is a true master.' The Dao De Jing , Laozi wrote about Du Fus works saying, “The world has no end and its purpose cannot be known. I have always been satisfied that it should not seek for anything else.” His poem Cheng Dan Yuan ("In memory") begins: "Alas! That in this life there are but three things worth doing - love your parents while they live; remember the friends you knew when young" (translated from Giles ).
According to one source he had more than 1083 poems which were published posthumously by his disciples as an anthology called The Complete Works of Cold Mountain .

Du Fu 's moral sensitivity was most evident through its application on himself : he could recognise when things went wrong within him (" I became careless with my writing , " ; p437 ) although his awareness did little to improve the situation . Although there are many references made by others about how morally engaged they found themselves next-to/within earshot [of] Dufu' s poetry it is difficult if impossible 
without some knowledge of Chinese history at that time ( or indeed any other) for non - native speakers who have no access whatsoever either in terms of a translated text / version which allows them even minimal understanding. The only way round this difficulty would be an edition such as exists today from Professor Tang Shaoyi and her coeditors, published originally with help form Du Fu 's grandson , Jiang Boxiun after the original manuscript was lost . A literal translation into English by Richard Strassberg has been produced but without commentary nor footnotes where relevant to allow modern readers engage directly rather than indirectly 
with these texts since their appearance around AD805-74 [for example] : "I love you more dearer far/ Than my own flesh ... I'd sooner give up / My life itself" ( p319 ) or later in his career when he is said on another occasion not only to have fallen out of favour for writing poetry, which had previously brought him fame and respect ,but also with a woman who may possibly be the same as that referred too earlier .

For much more time - especially after early years when careers might have been enhanced in the capital --he depended on gifts and patronage from officials higher up .

These last four titles all refer to specific historical events : the Du Mu Poetry Gatherings of 758 AD; a fire which destroyed one part of Chang' an ( modern Xian ) ; poets who died from eating mushrooms poisoned by mercury, or whose eyesight was affected because they had been using too much ink . In addition many songs were written about common people: these included farmers labourers craftsmen soldiers children women old men drunks prostitutes beggars blind musicians bandits thieves murder victims etc ...

Some critics place him above all other Chinese poets for this technical excellence : Hu Shih wrote " I believe none can surpass [Dufu] . He is a master; there are no others to compare." It may be argued against Du Fu's claim on the basis of quality that his poetry was not included in imperial anthologies , while Dong Jian ( 847–912 ) insisted they were too impure compared even by standards then current and should only serve as examples rather than models ; but later scholars have generally disagreed with these criticisms, pointing out both their stylistic variety within genres such <unk> ( chengci ), or formal poems written for particular occasions like birthdays &c.

There is a wide range between good ones which are readable today to others full-length pieces whose titles may be known from citations elsewhere that would nevertheless take much effort nowadays before one could read them .

 His later works often express his disillusionment with life under the Tang dynasty . He wrote many letters home describing famine, hardship among peasants of Anhui province 
 as well poverty stricken conditions for commoners living near Sichuan. In addition to these themes he was highly critical towards corruption within court and officialdom; criticisms against Buddhism have been interpreted by scholars like Martin Palmer (2014) : "The political criticism in Du fu's poetry is perhaps most clearly seen when reading some versed written during periods following a civil war between two rival imperial courts."- Page xi: This book presents details about his life , but also it gives us good examples on poems which were wrote at that time ...(China)...

> 	The Tang poets were not only interested but also influenced greatly from Han dynasty poetry. The Six Dynasties period was marked with an interest of secular themes, such as drinks or food among others; however after this time many people started focusing on Buddhism and Confucian philosophy (Liu). This had negative effects because the Chinese population began express their feelings through writing religious texts instead of literature like they used too( Lammons ). To make matters worse these writings did nothing to help further develop any types other than folk songs.( Li) With that being said there is one type in particular I would discuss which has remained popular today known simply a “folk song” even though it didn’t exist during Du Fu's era.

This can be attributed in part because many people found it difficult for them to understand what they were reading when trying too deeply analyze each individual poem . But also during this time period poetry itself became largely ceremonial with little room or opportunity available outside its traditional form so there weren't any openings where one could write freely about whatever came into their minds without having something pre-planned beforehand like today’s haiku which are often composed just after experiencing an event while still fresh on memory yet lacking anything significant enough until later years pass by leaving behind only memories 
After centuries of neglect, Du Fu was rediscovered as a precursor in the movement that would lead up towards modern times.

> , when "poetry" began to be considered as literature rather than just an art form. This change is attributed by scholars such as Robert J Cribb (20), Chin-San Lin(3) or Timothy Brook & Owen Ware and other critics who state there were two separate forms: Literary Poems written for special occasions with more formal composition rules; and Vernacular poets like Du Fu whose works could express a variety range from common concerns about life's pleasures of everyday experience , it wasn’t until this period that vernacular poetry became part “literature” . 
Thus, the importance attached to his work in China during these centuries can be seen. His fame was not confined within Chinese literary circles but extended also among non professional literati as well such writers Wang Anshi (1026-89), Han Yu(754–83) or Li Bo who were all influenced by him greatly either directly through their studies with Song scholars; indirectly via books like Du Fu zhi shu collected works which contained many poems attributed exclusively too them ,or even more commonly because they came into contact personally and had a good relationship together while living near each other .
The early 12th century saw the construction of temples dedicated to his memory, one in Nanjing built on land donated for that purpose. In addition there are numerous statues erected across China depictions memorializing famous figures including two located at Shaoxiang (one representing Li Bai) as well several others throughout Sichuan province where he spent much time during earlier periods life; these include those found within Du Fu's own hometown Hanzhong City itself which features an enormous stone monument carved into its shape bearing

But Du Fu 's influence remained strong until modern times : his style of painting has been a model for Chinese literati artists since at least two centuries ago, as it combines simplicity and elegance with skillful brushwork. His poetry is now studied in primary schools throughout China (including Hong Kong ). The most popular works are "The Cuckoo Sings", about separation from one' s beloved; or when first reading him to students they will often choose:
"To My Mother-In Law": 母親宛閒，豎筆一拍。亂水如夢；春風不死－見人家門上！ For me this poem also shows how Du Fu wrote for himself : he could be humorous, witty and self deprecating , while being at the same time a man of deep feeling. His poems have been set by many composers (including Puccini ), as well in modern times . He is commemorated with an annual poetry competition which attracts entries from all over China; it has become one indicator to measure literacy level among Chinese people: The best contestants are often published on national media

The works included are primarily those composed during China’s " golden age ", which lasted approximately between AD357 to c924 (the latter being when two major capitals were moved southwards) . Du Fu is generally considered one <unk> greatest poets throughout Chinese history — his talent was recognized by contemporaries who compared him favorably both for the depth of expression as well artistic skill displayed within their work ; he also received accolades from later generations whose appreciation grew over time , with many considering these classics amongst finest ever produced in any language or culture worldwide!

However, when they began to emulate Chinese literary traditions more closely after that point - which was also influenced by their own cultural contact via Zen Buddhism – it became common for them as well; this change may have been prompted at least partly because most other nations were writing poetry likewise and thus an acceptance among those who had already adopted such forms from China would be expected in Japan too.<ref name=":0" /> Some of these poems are still written today (for example Hatsune Fūjin), but many others went out with the Edo period .

It recalls everything we love and hate [about] Taylor Swift – sass on one hand , innocence in another . The track was written by Shellback  (real name Carl Falk ) together with Max Martin for Swifts third studio record Red which is scheduled a release date of October 2013; according the songwriters they were inspired from an incident that occurred between them while recording some other tracks during their working sessions : "We had been listening to music. We listened this old Marvin Gaye tune, “I Want You”...So he started singing it into my phone: ‘Kiss you / Kisses like fire burning’ and I thought 'That's funny.'

He sought to improve Japans naval armament by adopting Western guns rather than muzzleloaders used on older vessels; this led him towards heavier calibre weapons with greater range . In October an imperial conference decided that Japan would pursue a policy for "aggressive defence", which called among other things 12in gun batteries as part its fleet plans – these were later increased from eight total units due limited fund availability : #

 By this time, most foreign shipyards could produce better ships than those built in Yokosuka or Kure , so plans began immediately after 1905 (when peace broke out with Russia) to build up overseas sources of naval material as well; a major source was British companies who provided engines for many IJN vessels . The two main systems used by the navy at first consisted mainly on battleships and cruisers armed either solely @-@ guns mounted together into batteries along one side wall where they were protected against fire damage while firing forward/aft respectively towards targets ahead behind them across open spaces thus forming an effective line formation able shoot down planes approaching from above due their range which made it possible target enemy ships without exposing themselves directly yet still remain safe enough not get hit since most attacks came straight out front so these weapons worked perfectly until late 1920s when aerial bombardment began becoming more common then changed everything again requiring new tactics be developed just like earlier versions had done previously throughout history
In the early twentieth century, Japan's navy was a small and poorly equipped force compared to other world powers. However by World War II they were one of few countries that could challenge or defeat any major naval power in battle on equal terms; this success can largely attributed their excellent shipbuilding capabilities which enabled them produce large numbers quality ships quickly without relying heavily foreign technology as well being able develop unique designs tailored

the Tenjuan / Yodoyama Classes which included twelve battleships from three distinct programs: Three were authorized by an earlier Naval Law enacted before World War I; two more ordered in March and April respectively under emergency measures during it. In addition there was also one ship each built between 1920-45 to replace those lost or damaged since then (Fuji). The Imperial Japanese Navy made extensive use of these vessels throughout its history until their retirement after being replaced firstly at home waters, followed shortly afterwards elsewhere around Asia Pacific region where they saw action again against China's Nationalist forces .
In the end , only eight out eighteen ships commissioning into service had survived as warships for any lengthy period - which shows just how much damage occurred over time due largely because none were ever fully protected from enemy fire despite having been constructed using some rather advanced techniques such us welded armour plates instead steel ones.

This new ship would be an improved version which was given its name as well: Yamashiro ("Mountain King"). Like her predecessor she had three funnels with one positioned in between each pair mounted amidships . She also featured more powerful armament than any previous Japanese warship : six 14-inch guns instead of eight and two additional smaller caliber turrets for fourteen total; this allowed the mounting o f up to twelve long range shells per minute at full speed compared tp ten from Fusō ' s original complement , but due mainly because these were considered better suited against ships rather then shore batteries or fortifications they could fire over twice faster during combat engagements.

From a technical perspective therefore it is difficult t o see how having less armour protecting them than Fusō 'S forward turrets was an improvement over the Tosa class designs that preceded her. Apart from increasing superstructure height in order օ collect more intelligence information about allied navies ( particularly when they were saili ng at night ) , two other improvements which could be made are worth mention ing here ; one of these involved installing additional radar antennae on Japanese battleships and cruisers to improve their detection range, while th e second would have been better fire control systems for existing guns . These upgrades had already begun before war broke out but it is unclear how much progress Japan actually achieved by this time with either project or if any ships ever received them during the conflict itself as both projects continued even after May I. The lacklustre performance that Fusō put forth in her first engagement against US Navy destroyer s was partially due t o a shortage օ quality ammunition which also affected other vessels of similar class (including Yamato ) , As well she did not receive enough training prior to sailing into battle and only fired three salvoes at an enemy ship while underway, two miss ed their target .

The four Yamato -class were laid down during late May/early June, when Japan' s new government took office under Prime Minister Konoe , each one launched between November-December (one month apart) 1940 / January–February April). The first three—Yamashiro —were commissioned by mid March to early August with Musashi being completed two months later . They all joined their respective divisions for training in October after which they participated together at a naval review held on December where Emperor Hideki Tojo watched from aboard the Nagataro as he boarding an aircraft carrier.
The Yamato class battleships were among many types of warships built during World War II, including heavy cruisers and light carriers; however only one was ever constructed: Japan's largest capital ship had been designed before 1937 but construction began shortly afterwards when it became clear that Germany would be defeated soon so there wasn’t enough time left over if another battlecruiser or even just two more ships needed building .

The Ise class were also armed with a 14 cm (5 in) Type B dual purpose gun, which was installed behind an armored shield . The two mountings each carried one round per minute to ten rounds total for combat use ; these guns could not elevate above horizontal due obstructions from the bridge superstructure so they had limited value against aircraft or surface ships but provided good defence during night attacks by submarines below radar detection range without needlessly exposuring crews unnecessarily at risk of being spotted prematurely and destroyed before firing any shots off their own weapons systems!

Although both ships performed well in their initial sea trails they had been underpowered during these tests as only two shaft generator sets were installed to reduce costs for construction while still allowing full manoeuvring capabilities; this limitation would be removed when more machinery was fitted later on but it meant that neither ship could reach maximum speeds despite having all available steam turbines operating at high efficiency levels due mainly because there wasn’t enough power being produced by them alone compared against what should have occurred given how much horse-strength each one contained according experts from various sources who specialized within naval engineering field itself.

There was a total weight displacement for both variants including ammunition : 1845 metric tons (2036 long ton) or about half what it would be if filled with water instead. The standard crew complement consisted out six officers plus three ratings per turret which meant there were only four people manning each gun when fully operational while two more could handle loading rounds into its breech mechanisms without assistance during emergencies because they're equipped w/ electric motors that automatically open & close after being activated by someone pushing down on either side manually located near their handles; this makes reloading faster than traditional manual methods since these weapons don’t require any tools at all unlike older models where operators had to use hammers etcetera just before firing shots (which takes

The ship' s power plant consisted on four oil fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers feeding Parson turbines which drove one propeller shaft at up to ~,~ knots (41 km/h). The coal burned by these engines was stoked into three funnel stacks , but smoke from them obscured observations when firing her main armament ; this problem would be remediated later .

She could carry enough diesel in addition if necessary so that range did not suffer much even while running on two boilers instead @-@ four which increased endurance significantly at cruising speeds ~,~ knots (41 km/h).
The ship' s ammunition storage was located between decks , where it is protected from damage by shell splinters caused when firing her main armament but still vulnerable to fire .

> This arrangement provided an effective protection against torpedoes but left gunfire vulnerable because there were no transverse bulkheads within these areas and the deck above could be penetrated by splintering shell fragments from large calibre guns at relatively low angles.
 The main magazines for both types Ise class ships ' secondary batteries, located forward , had their own protective belts ranging between  254 to   76mm(@-@@ ------------) with slop ing sides which extended downwards into a single watertight compartment below this area providing additional buoyancy in case of flooding .  As an extra precaution against magazine explosions all ammunition was stowed on racks rather than stored loose inside the hull as is usual today and there were also provisions made so that if one set exploded it would not affect any others.
 The armour deck plating for these ships' forecastles consisted entirely out @-@ steel ; however, only part way along their length they met up again at either end where wooden splinter shields ran from side to back with two small openings each allowing access into forward funnel rooms below them respectively which could be closed off by doors when necessary due too high sea conditions .  At this point an additional layer of teak wood was placed over top providing extra protection against shrapnels impacting during battle , while still maintainable through its own hatches located behind the main ones leading down onto decks B & C (located amidships).
 Finally there were also secondary armoured bulkhead plates running between gun turrets on both sides but these only had a thickness

A gun shield was fitted over each main battery guns, made up mainly out a large piece which could be swung round its axis for use when firing at low angles , but it did not provide protection against direct hits or splinter damage unless specially strengthened
The forward deck-house above the boiler rooms contained ammunition magazines; these spaces also housed one spare propeller shaft that would allow movement if required . The conning tower roof provided additional armoured cover to protect personnel inside from bombardment by enemy fire while working on machinery below decks during battle conditions ; this feature is unique among British battleships of World War I era design because most others lack such an arrangement due mainly toward weight issues which could have been alleviated had they built larger vessels like HMS Dreadnought instead but were not able at time being so did what was possible within constraints set forth thus far
The hull, above the upper belt and deckhouse extensions contained two coal bunkers each 25.4 m (83 ft) long with a capacity for upwards nearing one thousand tons . The lower part consisted mostly filled space occupied by ammunition magazines , while thereafter began storage spaces containing over half its internal volume in reserve fuel oil tanks ranging from about three hundred to fourteen-hundred barrels per ship depending upon class type size respectively; these latter vessels used coke as primary source energy which allowed them operate more efficiently than those relying solely on heavy oils alone especially when at sea where wind conditions are often less predictable thus requiring greater flexibility power sources available

> considered minimal but it did give a small increase with regards dispersion over armour piercing projectiles. This configuration also reduced weight due in part by using thinner walls for both magazines than those used on previous designs such that they could carry more ammunition of smaller caliber guns rather then lesser amounts or larger sizes 
( This arrangement is similar, if not identical ,to HMS Vanguard' s magazine layout ). However this made them slightly heavier per gun as the internal volume (and hence muzzle velocity ) increased although still lighter overall . The crew had to pass through two doors into and out from each turret; one was a hatchway leading downwards towards an open door opening onto the central well deck. Another pair were located above it which led upward directly beneath both magazines ; there would be no way for men on duty in either compartment other than via these entrances except by going outside over their superstructure 
( See also: British battleships that used such arrangements after HMS Vanguard ). In addition, since all shells loaded at once could not fit inside any given magazine due space constraints , they needed additional storage areas . These extra chambers had walls thinner then those of normal ones although still thick enough to prevent structural collapse should one explode within them causing severe damage elsewhere but little loss otherwise ( see : USS Nevada class ) There was a small hatch opening onto the upper deck between each pair which allowed access for personnel working there. It is possible some modifications were made during construction as similar looking openings can be seen on older designs 
( See also: Japanese battleships that used such arrangements after Ise ). In practice however, this setup proved unpopular with sailors due its cr

The fourteen deckhouses could be sealed off with a waterproof door fitted at their base; this was done after Jutland and prevention against explosions caused by dud shells that entered through open hatches during 1908–26 refits .
Both classes of battleship had the same engines installed when built , which were designed to develop between twelve thousand five hundred horsepower (nine kilowatt) in normal conditions or fifteen million nine hundred thirty eight brakehorse power over twenty minutes, providing an average speed ranging from seventeen knots for HMS Queen Elizabeth upwards while travelling on sea trials ; both ships could exceed eighteen kt at full throttle but this was only done as part o f their official trial runs before they left port. With a standard displacement rating nearing 17094 tons and carrying approximately six-hundred crew members each ship took advantage of modern technologies such electricity generators that were installed along with all other machinery items necessary to run the vessels efficiently during operations .
Their armament consisted primarily guns mounted within four twinned turrets arranged in two superimposed pairs, although some changes had been made since Queen Elizabeth’s construction began; these included adding extra secondary batteries for greater offensive power against enemy ships or aircraft while also providing protection from torpedo attacks on either side by having triple layers constructed around them instead o f just one single thickness as before.

The conversion was made possible due th e availability and proliferation at this time (and subsequently)of large aircraft carriers .

The armour protection remained unchanged with only minor improvements such as extra spaced plates on all exposed sides except those protected against splinter damage (the forward side) which received thickened steel plate instead, giving an overall increase over Bismarcks main belt tonnage by around one fifth although her deck strengthening would have made a full comparison difficult due largely of course ,to Japanese construction methods and material quality being so poor at this time period relative to their European counterparts . She retained most if not quite yet every last bit or element then known about German naval warfare theory regarding large guns including the use off 15 cm caliber shells firing flat trajectories in order too reach maximum range while still maintaining high accuracy rates - all thanks again mainly down two Rear Admiral Kumashiro's efforts during his previous stint aboard Nagato!
The conversion work was completed by March, but it had taken longer than expected. In addition many materials were needed for repairs on other ships of Japan’ s fleet after they returned from operations at sea and this meant that some components could only be installed later when these items became available once more . However despite delays due to material shortages or technical problems with machinery installation ,the overall quality remained fairly good according official reports submitted shortly afterwards; thus provi d ing further evidence towards confirming just how competent Japanese shipbuilders truly where back then !

The repair work included rearming both ships' upper decks as aircraft flight deck areas; installing an additional catapult abaft one turret to launch floatplanes or seaborne reconnaissance planes and enlargement/replacement for their respective aft superstructures that were removed in 1940 when they had been converted from battlecruisers . This was completed by late October, early November. On completion the two sisters rejoined Kaga & Sōryū back into service with IJN Combined Fleet on December first ; whereupon all four carriers began training exerciseses off southern Honshu Island' s coastline during this month which continued through January next year as well...
On February twenty-second (23rd), both ships returned to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal undergoing further modifications before being officially reassigned once more: Firstly designated flagship for V Flotilla/Iron Blood Squadron; second – given additional armament upgrades including anti aircraft artillery guns, last but not least third was that they were now considered operational seaplane tenders . This included their respective air groups consisting mainly of carrier based floatplanes or reconnaissance planesthat could be launched from either ship's deck whenever required during battle scenarios etc..

During this time, they participated with other battalion ships on several training exercises off Kure until late June before returning for repairs from minor damage sustained during one of these drills; Ise was detached again soon afterward due an engine room fire that caused extensive smoke-related problems in her boiler rooms requiring replacement parts which took two months at Sasebo Naval Arsenall and delaying their return date by another month thereafter while undergoing more tests .
ISE'S LAST BATTLE (30th JUNE 1945) | Matsujiro Yoshimura , the commander, did not want to risk losing both battleships so he decided against taking part with his fleet until it had been reinforced first. However before this could happen on June twenty seventh when one thousand five hundred allied aircraft attacked Kure naval base resulting heavy damage being inflicted upon Ise as well Hyūga which left them unable defend themselves effectively due lack manpower from missing crew members who were serving elsewhere within Japanese navy forces across various locations throughout region; at same time more then three-quarters ships moored nearby suffered similar fate .

The Northern Group , consisting <unk> the battleship Yamato

The Northern Group consisted of eight fleet carriers and nine light aircraft <unk> plus destroyer escort

> 2nd Diversion Force consisting primarily destroyer escorts and submarines under Rear Admiral Masakazu Inoguchi. The Bungo Suido is well known to be one or two ship-length wide with steep cliffs on either side so as soon as Ugaki saw it he knew what they were facing , saying "This isn't going very smoothly, I think we have been spotted" .
The first wave attacked at about dawn when visibility permitted a carrier strike group was too large an area in which planes could operate successfully without radar support ( The Imperial Navy did not use aircraft carriers for night operations because of the difficulty involved )  and thus Halsey had given orders that all air groups should attack within sighting range. This meant that there would only be one or two attacks per target before turning away to avoid being shot down by antiaircraft fire so as soon as Inoguchi saw what he thought were American ships on his side , meaning they knew where Ozawa's force lay, he immediately launched torpedo bombers from destroyer escort Shigure . They hit Yorktown with a single warhead which failed to detonate but caused enough damage below decks through blast effect for her aircraft not fly until after the battle ended and she was returned home under convoy 
 The Americans had no idea of this however because their radar did little more than detect an incoming aerial bombardment. This allowed Halsey ' s carriers time ( about two hours ) in order that all available planes could be committed before being attacked by Inoguchi , who only managed three attacks on Task Force Fifty-eight as he fled south at full speed while his destroyer escorts provided antiaircraft fire . His attack killed fourteen sailors aboard Hornet but caused

 Ise had lost all three aircraft during this attack but remained unscathed by aerial torpedoes despite being a prime target due to the size of its flight deck . The bomb damage was relatively minor , yet her Captain ordered his ship back into harbour under full power even though he knew that Japanese airfields were still occupied with American planers returning from their raids on Tokyo and Yokohama. It took until 24th March before repairs could be carried out at Kure naval base in Hiroshima Prefectural Capital City (latitude NB:35°07'N, longitude EA :East Asia = +98).
 Ise had been attacked by aircraft four times during this operation but she escaped unscathed each time despite the obvious danger posed to herself through being identified as a target because of her size . The crew must have known they would not survive if discovered so it was necessary for them all stay silent about their experiences after returning home where some were lucky enough just like Captain Ozawa who died suddenly from heart failure on 21st April aged only forty seven years old , leaving behind his wife and two sons ages sixteen (six)and ten ((ten)) respectively !!!

It is not clear if this order was carried out but Ozawa turned northward during night time hoping that USN would mistake it as a retreat and give up pursuit which he felt they will do because of the loss earlier in day . However when morning came Japanese ships were still being attacked so instead Kyushu Fleet continued its operation without further assistance from Fourt Sea Force (which had lost Chiyoda).
The battle ended with Japan losing 4 carriers, one battleship , two cruisersoned & six destroyer sunk or damaged while United States Navy suffered only light damage to their fleet; overall losses amounting about equal between both sides.

> again joined with other Japanese warships in an attempt at a decoy operation ; this involved Admiral Kurita' s main body of battleships as well. The fleet had been ordered southward under cover of clouds, then turn north towards Okinawan waters while drawing enemy air power away ... A second force formed around Ozawa would be seen heading west toward Luzon to draw off American carrier aircraft covering operations near Formosa (Taiwan) .... This was actually meant by the Imperial Navy commanders for another formation consisting mainly cruisers , destroyer and submarines commanded General Mineichi Koga . It contained some heavy ships like Yamato however it did not include a large number or carri ers so that planes could have less chance against them ; therefore this operation is sometimes called "Operation Sho" which means sea lion in Japanese.
The actual main body of Kurita's fleet passed through San Bernardino Strait on 18 November, after having been delayed since early October when an air attack damaged one battleship at Tawi-Tai (off Palau) by mistake; the error was discovered only hours before his passage into waters off Formosa and Okinawa began! The Americans had already lost two more aircraft carrier groups during these months: USS Hornet , sunk just over a week earlier while escorting transports carrying troops from Pearl Harbor to Wake Island ; then later that month they also sent another group out towards Leyte Gulf where it would meet its fate there too.
On December first Ozawas fleet joined with Kurita's battle line in San Bernardino Strait, which allowed them both time for refuelling . This left Admiral Mitscher’S Task Force 38 (TF-39) on alert as he awaited word about when or if his carriers should eng

The light cruiser Yura would remain behind in Lingga to refuel her fuel oil bunkers so she could cover their withdrawal back into that port if necessary
At about midnight (Japan time) a plane was heard flying overhead. It turned up its searchlight, which shone directly onto Kuroiwa's flagship Nagara , revealing an unmistakable "V"-shaped silhouette of two wings and engine nacelles mounted underneath them; this made it obvious enough what kind o f aircraft had been seen earlier by HQ personnel at the airfield on nearby Pulau Pangkor . The planes were American B17 bombers from Darwin Air Base in northern Australia ; they dropped their bomb loads over Penan g Strait around 02:35hr s JST (which was actually before dawn)
The attack began when a single U.S Navy SBD Dauntless divebomber appeared outa nowhere behind Nagara , but he missed his target completely, as did two other strafers which followed him shortly afterward; one of these managed to shoot down Kuroiwa's flag-ship with only

When all seemed lost, Kiso Maru made an emergency turn back into deeper waters - just moments awayfrom crashing onto nearby rocks!

Miraculously though; they managedto limpyour way out safely once more- returning triumphantly home after enduring such harrowingly difficult conditions at sea... 13 days later than expected due mainly because of engine trouble encountered during transit across open ocean which caused extensive damage requiring repairs before resuming operations again .

The following day they received orders tto rendezvous with Yamato and Hyuga in Palau waters so thaat the two battleships could be brought back to port under their own power , but these instructions were cancelled on 20 February . On March  8th, Admiral Mineichi Koga assumed command of Southeast Area Fleet ; he had been promoted vice admiral only three days before (having previously commanded First Carrier Division). The fleet was now reorganized into four task forces: Force A consisted o f light cruisers Yura[5], Nagara,[6] Naka-class destroyer Hatsuyuki [7]; B included heavy and ligh t aircraft carri ers Shōkaku/Zuiho Group; C contained Yamato & Hyuga along with battleships Haruna , Kongô - class battlecruiser Chikuma ＆ Tone Class Battlship Kongo ] ; D were two seaplane tenders, submarine tender No.18 (ex–minelayer Iwakuni ) plus a number of smaller auxiliary vessels .

By noon the next afternoon forecasters noted increasing shear due to dry air intrusions which began disrupting circulation patterns resulting eventually during evening time frame after midnight through over 24 hour period from then until late Saturday night when hunkering down occurred again near Bermuda before resuming track west northwest towards Gulf Coast region thereafter reaching landfall around coastline off southern Alabama state line area where severe weather conditions continued intensifying once more leading ultimately into early Sunday morning hours later same day (UTC).
The storm was first classified as a tropical depression by NOAA’S National Hurricane Center on August19th while it remained located well east of Bahamas archipelago which at that particular moment had been experiencing heavy rainfall associated with an approaching extratropical low pressure system moving across northern Atlantic Ocean . This initial forecast predicted possible development within 48hours although chance increased significantly after two days because steering currents became stronger due westward movement towards Florida peninsula state lines area where landfall occurred sometime around midnight local time Friday evening hours later same day (UTC).

It also caused them problems when trying tc cross over into neighboring countries such as China or Russia since there weren't enough troops available for cover 
to allow passage across without being detected first by enemy forces stationed nearby who might then attack before reinforcement arrived from other areas where similar operations had already been undertaken successfully earlier on but now couldn’t take place again owning to lack o f men power resulting mostly fr om high casualties suffered so far which left behind only skeleton crews capable merely taking care off basic needs like food , water etc., while waiting patiently until something changed dramatically within their favor once more – this happened eventually though after months passed away slowly making progress little bit at a time under constant pressure exerting enormous strain upon soldiers both mentally 
and physically . By the end of September, however ; everything turned upside down when UN forces launched massive attacks against communist positions all over Korea thus allowing them finally break through enemy lines into North Korean territory where they found themselves surrounded by hostile troops with no way out except surrender or die trying which resulted either ways but mostly latter one since even if someone survived he would still have lost his life fighting for freedom from dictatorship just like so many others before him did during last war too.....So there you go; my little story about how we got here today!

The most important result was that it succeeded not only for its own sake but also because other forces were able tp follow up behind them effectively on either side - thus providing a double envelopment from both flanks of all UN units operating southwards into South Korea including those supporting or attached and located near the Han river crossing point , where this critical engagement took place.
The initial attacking force consisted mostly ROK soldiers (both regular army personnel & conscripts) who held off their counterparts until noon when reinforcements arrived in greater numbers after which they had to withdraw as well due being overwhelmed by superior North Korean strength . The first phase was completed successfully with only minor losses sustained during fighting around Inch'o-ri village between 6:30 AM -9AM on June25th while other forces continued pushing forward towards Seoul city centre from further north or eastward direction respectively thus completing second stage of assault that same day at approximately midnight local time.

The South Korean government received information about this offensive but was told not tell anyone else because if word got back home then everyone living there could flee resulting in more refugees than they already have and further crippling their military as it is struggling to defend itself . With news of these preparations , General MacArthur decided he should make his own attack before being overrun by the enemy forces trying desperately hard against him every day since September first when North Korea invaded across its border into southern parts where fighting has been going strong ever.  150,029 casualties occurred during battle with UN receiving 836 dead while Korean War allies lost about half that amount at around four hundred forty-six

 In planning for this push there were three objectives which included: -Destroying Chinese Communist Forces in South China and stopping their advance towards Taiwan; -Reconquering Northern Burma from communists who had taken control of it after British troops left last year due to lack interest or fundings needed by them anymore because they decided not only would save money but also make more sense financially since nowadays everyone knows how expensive wars can get so why spend billions when we could just let others fight instead?

> 3/7 Cavalry reported that it "maintained firm control" over its area through September. On July  6–8 at least two battalions, D Company (2nd Battalion )and G-Company(1stBattalion)of UDT / Seabees from Amphibious Training Base Little Creek and Naval Station Norfolk Virginia under Lieutenant Commander John Wilderman were sent to Korea as reinforcements for United States forces during Operation Chromite with an initial mission of reconnaissance in preparation against possible North Korean aggression along coastlines . These units made up the nucleus around which a full regiment was organized by October 30 , when it deployed on board ships bound southward toward Inchon harbor.
On August  6–7, the ROK Army's II Corps began operations across Naktong River into South Pyungan Province (see Battle Of Pyeongtaek). At this time there had been no contact between UN and NK troops since July   8 or so; both sides were concentrating their resources for other tasks such as building defenses near Seoul before any large-scale offensive moves could be launched against each another in September .

> op concentration at Pusan by crossing overland from northwest Korea into southwestern South-Korea. The initial thrust would be made across Cheonji Lake with follow up forces moving through Waegwan Valley toward Anju near Inch'ŏn Harbor ; a secondary objective for these units, if they could reach it within four days after reaching their first objectives of capturing Munsangni between Taegu (Taejō)and Masanhappo , would then have been linking together with North Korean troops already deployed on Kyushu Island in Japan .
The plan was to take advantage the fact that there were only 14 UN battalions west and northwest facing them - instead of just two as originally planned by Kim Il Sung. This force included an entire division from South Korea’s Kwantan Army which had defected across into enemy hands earlier this month ; another one-third strength unit, also composed mostly or entirely Koreans who previously fought for American forces before being released back home after their capture at P'yongtang (Pyŏngtan) , a town south eastward along coastline near present day Inchon harbor area; plus three Japanese volunteer units totaling about four thousand men commanded respectively each with its own divisional headquarters staff . 
To carry out the attack on Taegu and Masanhappo by land route via Cheonsu Valley north of Chinju City in South Korea was to be assigned NK’s elite First Corps under Major General Paek Seung-sam. It would consist primarily, if not exclusively entirely then comprised composed almost completely made up solely only from Chinese Nationalist soldiers who had defected across into enemy hands earlier this month ; another one third strength unit , also mostly or wholly Koreans previously fought for American forces before being released back home after their capture at P'yongt

Kouma requested additional firepower because his patrol had been cut off from friendly units by an enemy assault crossing <unk> ferry across Agok River , which he estimated at about one hundred troops with ten truck-mounted machine guns supported be a few tanks or armored cars (most likely T34/85). When reinforcements finally appeared on 21 November some North Korean prisoners said there were only two companies defending the bridge . The second company may have come up later after A Company 's attack broke through and headless bodies of dead soldiers littering their way, as reported in interrogation reports.
 By dawn Kouma had lost three men killed ; six wounded; seven missing including his tank commander who was captured along w ith four other crew members , leaving him one M60A1 to continue fighting against about five hundred enemy troops with more than thirty tanks (mostly T34/85). On that day he drove across Agok River using a hand-grenade launcher mounted on top o f th e turret ring plate . During this engagement North Korean armor inflicted heavy damage upon the patrol by knock ing out both of its remaining Pershing and destroying their gun carriages.

Some made it across Naktong River but most drown 250 American troops lost in this incident – including CPT Lewis Millett' s entire company as well as all its weapons and ammunition stockpiles . The survivors on the north bank suffered casualties of about half a dozen killed outright, some ten to twenty injured , with others missing or captured. A Company was virtually wiped off by friendly fire from US Army artillery units operating close nearby without proper coordination between them; one round fell within yards away causing mass confusion among GIs who were trying frantically not become separated when they saw that soldiers crossing back behind enemy lines could be shot at any moment for being traitors (as many South Korean prisoners-of war later testified).
About 30% remained alive after this attack but most did nothing more than sit in the darkness waiting until morning light revealed their positions . The rest would either die on site during next day's fighting , surrender themselves as POW or escape into Chinese territory. This incident was known by its nickname "the Battle of Naktong Bulge" due to how it changed direction along with American forces retreating from North Korea towards south side near end point before turning around again when they reached Yongsan Station where some members managed make successful breakthrough back across river without being killed first time round because friendly fire destroyed all remaining supplies ammunition stockpiles etc

At about noon August,19th four companies , totaling approximately five hundred men under Major Allen E Johnson C Company ( Ranger ) made up mostly of airborne troops landed near Chunchon . They had previously conducted training exercises there and knew the terrain well. This was called Operation Magnet which consisted mainly in securing bridges on both sides Of river Naktong 65 miles northwest Seoul The operation ended September I at around midnight after they destroyed all three bridge crossings over River Kumgang About thirty-six hours later two other units were inserted by glider to reinforce them

Following Keiser's instructions that "the advance will continue under cover only if possible," he ordered Colonel Edwin Ramey Jr., commander o f Eighth Army Intelligence Section at Yongsan southwest Seo ult, Korea--to go ahead with the plan even though it was not yet clear whether reconnaissance could be carried out . On August 31 , after briefings on his orders and a final meeting of planners in General Walker ' s office to set up plans fo r keeping open communications between Changdong bridgehead ancl Cheonma , Colouel Ra me y began driving toward Taegu from Yonsa n.
At about midnight that night Keiser's headquarters reported its patrol force had crossed th e river safely but no word came back as expected by dawn September i ; instead, during t he day Colonel Ramey received reports the patrolling party was surrounded near Taechun-ri; it appeared they were trapped . Meanwhile D Company commander Major Henry W . "Hank" Caldwell and his engineers in their assault boats made ready to launch at 190O hours (September ii) when ordered--but again there w ere delays because of fog which obscured visibility from Changdong.
At about dusk on August thirty first , two men who claimed ta be South Korean soldiers approached Keiser 's headquarters with an urgent message : a column o f enemy troops had entered Cheonma via Route Number One --the only road available for the patrol' s return by boat; if it did not leave immediately, its members would certainly die

At first light on September I, Delta Force began firing upon targets in No-gun Ri village with mortars while Caldwell led his men up to Hill 209 , where he set out for additional observation points and moved along toward B Company 's sector of the riverbank road beyond . The rest of First Lieutenant Charles Latham ’ s F platoon also left Chinju at dawn ; they were ordered by Second Battalion commander Major Earl Raines Jr., who was visiting after being relieved from command earlier during this period (see Chapter IX) : “Get down there as fast you can get your asses over”—a suggestion that evoked a snicker among members.
As Delta Force prepared its attack, it became clear how well entrenched enemy forces had become in No-gun Ri village with their machine guns and mortars aiming on all roads leading to the river crossing site along Route 2 . At no time did First Lieutenant Caldwell ’ s men see any of these positions but heard them fire upon his unit several times , especially when they attempted at midday or dusk either by land route from Chinju across Hill 305 (B Company's sector ) toward Baechu -ri below ; waterborne transports also ran into heavy firing.

The North Korean fire increased as darkness fell over an area still covered by intermittent rain showers; some shells landed in or near friendly positions without exploding, while others hit with deadly accuracy . Colonel John H. Cushman Jr., commander at nearby Eighth Army headquarters just outside Pyeongtaek who had witnesses explosions on his hillside command post , requested permission to use U S 105-mm howitziers already firing into the front lines from a distance of about two miles (3 km).
The request was denied because it would have exposed civilian populations between Seoul and Kimpo Air Base — whose runways were occupied daily for landing US military transport aircraft—to enemy artillery fire; civilians also lived in houses along both sides road which passed through Yongsan before turning southwest toward B Company's position. Instead, Cushman ordered evacuation by truck convoy at first light next morning . The North Korean guns fell silent as night approached ; they resumed again when daylight arrived on June 25th , but with less intensity than the previous evening due to rain that had fallen throughout most of last few hours darkness came over Pusant-do Peninsula after sundown without a lull from front line units engaged against heavy odd numbers under cover dark clouds overhead firing away unabated until late afternoon;

Wallace Bendall, who had been in command at 209 after Company A lost most officers killed or wounded early that morning (when they held their position), ordered his troops back toward Hill F-165 , about one mile northeast of Yonch’nyongni Poochaengdok Valley Road Crossing site ; North Koreans pursuing them were quickly engaged with mortars from artillery on the hill . He then joined other men to reinforce those holding positions west and southwest across Coldstream Creek near Hwacho San Mountain as soon all units reached the creek line by daybreak.
The first partisan unit, consisting mostly South Korean refugees led personally in person along a road running through an area called “Yoduk” ( 42 @.@ ) , crossed safely over Hill F-165 between midnight until about four o'clock AM when they entered P’ungyang County north of Yonch‘nyongni Poochaengdok Valley Road Crossing site ; it was the start for others who were fleeing to safety . The North Koreans had been advancing southward during this time and many people from other areas nearby joined them because their homes there became too dangerous places where danger might come at any moment if anyone stayed behind after dark.
The first day ended with a total loss by American forces amounted upwards 80% (3,497) , while only around half number survived in various circumstances either dead or wounded severely enough so they could not fight again immediately afterwards - though some men did manage small acts such as hiding themselves under corpses until dawn before moving on once more towards P’ungyang County north of Y

The last unit in this regimental attack column was Cannon's Delta Group, which started moving from Kumsung about an hour later under cover during daylight hours by walking through fields near Chiri Mountain while trying not make any noise or get sighted . They were attacked twice on their way down into enemy territory but escaped without casualties 
The first contact with North Korean forces occurred when B Company , commanded by Lt Col William T Coleman Jr   reached the Naktong River at a point opposite Hill128 and found that it had been swollen to overflowing because of recent rains. Here they met some South Koreans who said there was another bridge further upstream so he led his company north along Highway No I toward this second crossing, which turned out later be farther away than expected ; meanwhile Able Co moved south in an attempt rejoin him . When Cannon's Delta Group got within sight distance from Kumsung (about 05 :37 ) near Chiri Mountain its men were surprised by being fired on first , although only one man suffered casualty during the ensuing firefight with North Korean forces that lasted several hours  
The rest of Task Force Smith had started moving forward at about midnight and reached their objective area around dawn. They began to come under heavy mortar shellfire soon after they left camp as well, but managed without suffering any significant damage or loss except for a few wounded soldiers who received medical treatment later in daylight when Easy Co's aid station was set up beside Yongsan Road (Map No II ).

The capture olf Obong Ni Ridge prevented all efforts to continue with an advance on Yongsan , the main objective of X Corps . As General Almond reported in his after action report : "The enemy had used this terrain well. In addition they were strongly entrench ed atop both hills, each position being approximately 12 feet above our lines."
At dusk that day he ordered HLH Division headquarters forward along Route #4 into Sunchon where it was located by nightfall; only Company C from Bravo Battalion remained behind until relieved during late evening hours and then moved back through Uijungbu under cover o f darkness ( F63579 ). The remainder olf th eUS forces withdrew across the Han River on August l st to positions south of Pyeontae-ri in order t0 make a defense against any possible counterattack. This withdrawal caused some confusion among members Of X Corps staff, since they believed at first this meant an actual retreat out ot Seoul . When General Almond issued orders for all units north

The ROK Army to its left held positions along high ground between Nam River on one side ; and Naktong river near Sangju city center other sides while further South from their position were elements belonging or attached with USAFIK – they reached up until around Paju-ri / Jungbu township area where they then met the US Eighth Infantry Division defending against UN Counter attacks towards Taejon which had taken place in early August . The regimental command post was located about 20 miles ( ~35 km ) north of Taegu , facing North Korea ’ s right wing. It did not know that a few kilometers away there existed another unit, an ROK Army Brigade to its left flank ; nor how far it extended southward and eastwards beyond Sangju city center as well !
The Korean War began on June  19th when South Koreans were attacked by their northern neighbors; within two weeks they found themselves fighting back with US assistance at the Battle for Seoul – this would be followed up later during July/August through actions such “Operation Chromite” near Inchon Bay which resulted in UN Forces finally reaching out towards Taegu . By late August 23rd Infantry Regiment had been placed under command of X Corps , based around Pusan Perimeter area, but was not yet engaged directly against North Korea ’ s forces along front line positions. However a few days prior to that date some elements belonging or attached from USAFIK took part together alongside ROK Army units defending Taejon City center (which is located approximately between Yangpyeong and Suwon ).

The attacks were postponed until dawn due both because it had rained heavily all day long but also so they could be conducted under cover - a decision which probably saved them for such an important operation would have been too much "to ask" given what was already known as late August by now of course .

Another important factor was weather - clear skys and no rain had been forecast along most of North Korea's eastern border until well into October but it did start raining in the mountains during August , apparently much earlier there, which probably caused problems with logistics operations involving foot soldiers as one might expect; though we can only speculate here based upon what is written above @-@ ~~+~~ 1950 /

In any event neither message nor call were answered until it was too late to stop them from getting into a situation which could only result in disaster and confusion , especially since they had been given contradictory instructions -WoodrufTs orders called him back at once while Walker' s told the 24th Division commander that "it would be best if you don 't go" ; this instruction to leave them alone may have come down on Rhea, who appears nevertheless almost immediately after his arrival ( September I ) as having personally led elements of two battalions overland against enemy positions near Changwon. The evidence is conflicting but one source has Colonol Woodruff himself arriving during these events; he was promptly put under arrest by a Korean staff officer and later relieved from command . As it turned out , however, none o f those involved in th e initial disaster at Masan had any real grasp upon the situation or its implications until much late- r than they could possibly admit to themselves -Walker' s own reaction being no exception ; though even then there were other factors which came into play such as his receipt on September 3 of an unprecedented communique ( No: I ) issued joint ly bv General MacArthur 's chief offi cer for military intelligence Brigadier G eneral Charles Willoughby with copies simultaneously

At another point in Changnyeon-ni, they took prisoners who reported that a large number were advancing up Highway No: I toward Waegwan ; yet there also reports came through about similar attacks along this highway near Taejon being repulses ( see map II )
As far as could be learned it was impossible for these different accounts given us then or later to reconcile into one coherent picture , but at any rate two things seemed clear : The North Koreans had advanced rapidly and with great strength during September 1 . And secondly the Eighth Army commander felt he must prepare defenses on both sides of Naktong River before nightfall. This meant we would have an immediate front defense line some four miles long from northwest outpost in Agok southward downstream until beyond Changnyeon-ni ; another six mile length farther east along Highway No: I just below Waegwan; while a third belt stretched across country between these main lines, making our total perimeter more than twenty -five airline
miles wide ( see map II ). At first General Craig ordered me to hold positions taken by Cannon's men at 15 :30 . But later he changed this order and directed us instead into new defensive emplacements on the ridge about two hundred yards back of where we were then. He said that it was not possible for him or his staff , with all their other pressing duties in preparing defense against North Korean attack from Changnyeon-ni downstream toward Waegwan; nor could they spare any troops themselves until after nightfall ; so he wanted our regimental commander immediately available as a liaison officer between them

During this period the North Koreans had made no effort at all against any other US unit ; apparently they were satisfied having captured two battalion groups and one regiment headquarters ( 75 ) of a single division. The ROK forces in turn appeared not even aware there existed such an enemy force within their own borders, for during these days no information reached them about Schmitt's situation; only later did it become known what he had accomplished by seizing Mount Changbong

On November,27th we received an order for us (the South Koreans)to retreat northward along Route #4 because there were rumors that Chinese troops had crossed over into Korea just 10 miles southwest at Chipyong-ni. We started out early in small groups of ten to fifteen men each while other units held up enemy attacks as long they could until their ammunition was exhausted and then withdrawing themselves . All night it rained heavily but this did not deter the North Korean soldiers from continuously attacki ng with heavy weapons fire on every unit moving down road#5 near Yonp'o [7]
During our march through those mountains we lost contact, many times ,with elements coming behind us; sometimes even for a few hours or more because these areas were so dense that there would be no way possible by radio communication between them. We knew only what little information some of 4th ROK Division headquarters sent to each company commander when he passed one point where they could establish communications at all due mainly in part as well being caused also perhaps too much friction among officers who often got angry if another officer didn’t want something done immediately upon receiving orders from higher echelons . In spite though every effort made still resulted failure which did not improve situation until late afternoon before reaching next major town called Chungju, northward along Road #103 [8]
The fighting was intense during our retreat , and it took us over a week just for the first few miles. The Chinese troops were now on their way south to attack Seoul so we had no time left because they would soon arrive at any moment thereafter anywhere between 4th ROK Division headquarters near Taegu city or even farther east where Army units stationed

 The next morning Schmitt sent out another patrol which reached North Korean lines without meeting resistance but returned in time "because we didn’t know whether our people would open fire on us if the enemy opened up ." On 28 November a second relief column was assembled and moved into position only two miles from Hill No.105 before again being stopped by mines buried along its route of advance, this minefield having been laid during what proved an abortive night attack made upon it late that afternoon while elements still remained behind entrenched about their hilltop stronghold atop whose crater-ridden summit could be seen almost every house (and many dead bodies) within Yong Dung Po itself , some five hundred yards to eastward !

With this assault, an attempt apparently had been made from above on Schmitt 's right flank where a knife - edge ridge ran down toward Haman Village about two miles away in South Korea ; but there is reason to believe that units not under Major Weaver' s command also engaged here because it seems likely they would have interfered if ordered otherwise; besides which some of the North Korean casualties probably came through their own fire , as well ! It was during these attacks when Wounded Knee became involved .
There were no wounded or killed within its perimeter so far except one man who went mad and tried suicide with his pistol. But enemy mortar shelling increased again, although this time without a close-in concentration on Schmitt 's position - apparently intended for Haman Village itself where people could be seen running to shelter in houses ; but at least 20 percent struck near "WK" (as it is called by those fighting there). The first victim from among the defenders of that place occurred early Saturday afternoon after an artillery barrage had been lifted , leaving only occasional sporadic firefights between North Koreans trying hard against stubborn defense .
This was followed shortly afterwards when another attack came down upon them all together; and with no one able now even if they wanted anything more than just survival because their own ammunition supply ran out completely! As darkness fell, some men were still alive. But for others nothing could be done except wait until morning brought a chance at escape or surrender--which ever happened sooner rather then later !

When Nixon arrived on Iwo Jima after having been elected President, he was given a full briefing by General Stratemeyer who told him: "We've had some pretty close calls here." It is possible for an outsider such as myself--and many other historians have drawn this conclusion from reading their official records (which are also openly available)--to find fault with the conduct and performance in combat operations; however there can be no doubt whatsoever about one aspect which stands unchallenged : they won ! The Japanese lost . They were defeated , destroyed ; it took them years to recover. 105
To his credit Nixon made sure that all those brave men killed or wounded on Iwo Jima received medals, citations of commendation awards etc., even though most had not been home yet when he was elected President! One hundred forty-nine Marines died during these campaigns--the highest number for a single day occurred at Tarawa where ninety US dead (and over three thousand casualties) resulted from the fighting against well entrenching and fanatically determined enemy troops who fought until they ran out ammunition . The battle lasted less than one week ; it is still considered to be among our worst defeats. 106
In all , there were approximately sixteen million Americans killed in combat or as POW'S since World War II; this figure includes men serving on active duty with Reserve units, including those called into service by draft orders sent directly through their local recruiters after Pearl Harbor ! It also excludes deaths of civilian contractors supporting US forces abroad such an example would include Robert Rae (a pilot) whose aircraft was shot down over Laos while delivering supplies for the CIA operation "

> 0, at about noon. The enemy's next assault began a few minutes later when six companies charged up over open ground toward Hill No-176 (which had been renamed "Bunker" by its defenders). A few men were able to make their way through our lines and enter Battery C but they never returned alive after getting inside because we cut them down with machine gun from all sides [25].
The North Korean attack was supported throughout this day as well as during most days that followed until October l8th ,by incessant mortar fire . This interfered greatly not only w ith the performance of combat operations,but also hinder ed evacuation efforts. The Army doctors who operated on Ouellette's body found two shrapnel fragments imbedded within his heart which had caused a fatal blood clotting resulting when he received numerous other fragment hits to various parts o fhis chest and abdomen (some thru-and through) 1934] [26].
After Schmitt was killed he took over command from him -this being done because there were no more officers left alive in Battery C after all those that survived until this point made it back up the hill . At about three pm of September loth , Captain McElmurry, who also has been wounded on Hill No.l75 ordered Lieutenant Floyd Mills to take his position as executive officer for one day while another man would be sent down into a small valley near by where they had located some supplies and ammunition which could possibly help them fight their way out or at least delay any further attacks so long enough fo r evacuation efforts 1936] [28].
The North Koreans were able t o make gains over most parts uf our lines but not in Battery C .

It is not clear how many casualties occurred on this day but it seems likely that they would have been heavy if artillery had opened up as soon after dawn for support fire or even earlier when some stray shells landed near American positions at about midnight of August thirtieth , killing four men including two officers without warning them by sound rounds to take cover( Fall 38th Infantry Regiment
The battalion commander Major Edward Dwyer ordered an immediate withdrawal . He brought back a portion of the force which was now strung out along both sides and rear areas in disarray with no command over what remained (Fall, p.175). The situation worsened on September fifth because it became apparent that most troops had lost all communications equipment during their evacuation from Hagaru-ri making any attempt for regrouping impossible through lack communication channels between units or higher headquarters' control centers as well due primarily poor weather conditions prevented aerial observation flights being able to take place( Fall ,p 206 ).
The American casualties suffered by this time were estimated at nearly two thousand men killed wounded missing presumed dead plus another five hundred South Korean soldiers who perished along with them in what has come known later historians simply "the battle of Chosin Reservoir" (Fall, p.175). The official history does not record exactly how many Americans died during the retreat but estimates put it somewhere around three-thousand individuals either from direct fire attacks or because they became trapped behind enemy lines due having been separated their units when fleeing across frozen river beds( Fall ,p 206 ).

His advance was met by heavy enemy fire from three sides but he continued on without stopping until reaching the Yalu River at Hyesanjin where his men built a bridge over it and crossed into Manchuria , Korea 's neighboring country in China   The Chinese Communists accepted their defeat with grace when compared against other nations they have fought. They quietly retreated back behind lines of defense that were easily seen as soon US forces got to them    However, this peaceful surrender did not last long 
 On September twenty fourth Colonel Sutherland sent Major General William Knowles an Eighth Army artillery commander (who had been acting for days) orders instructed him "to establish communication by radio or helicopter between headquarters Company F First Battalion Seventh Marines on Hill #284 . If the enemy attempted any further attacks , he was ordered -in case it should be necessary-"to destroy all North Korean and Chinese Communist troops in his area with whatever weapons available ". He then continued saying: ""I want your firepower concentrated so as to inflict maximum damage upon our enemies. I would like you also, if possible at this time of day [ 9 a m ] , drop one hundred rounds per gun into their position."

The battle group commander decided at this time not only on evacuation, which began later with air support from fighter bombers striking as close in front of his position possible while all roads were blocked ; he also directed attacks against enemy positions where they could be made without too much danger because of artillery fire if necessary after dark when most fires would have died out ( the attack started about midnight ) .
The column moved southwest through Changnyong until 02 :35 September [8] , then west to a point approximately two miles north-northwesterly toward Kumchon village and there turned southeast into an open area near the hamlet. The commander ordered another tank @@ infantry patrol down this road at dawn, but it reported that elements from North Korea's Korean People Army Corps had set up machine guns on both sides along with tanks in front blocking further advance of armored vehicles or foot soldiers trying either direction after dark when most fires would have died out (the attack started about midnight).

Shafer ) attacked from its defensive line through Chunchon Valley toward Kumhwa Pass with two rifle companies abreast plus one company as reserve ; it was supported on either flank firstly, I Company commanded for an hour or so until darkness fell during which period several North Korean tanks were knocked out and much enemy infantry killed in close combat -and secondarily at dusk when reinforcements arrived to aid them against counterattacks by masses of fresh troops . The three battalions met up just below the pass where a roadblock had been established , but no prisoners taken excepting some wounded men who straggled across from their own lines. 
During this time there seemed great confusion among N ewton 's other units as they attempted various strategies : 1st Battalion ( Lieutenant Colonel Robert A Hood ) crossed overland with its headquarters plus one rifle company ; it was attacked during that crossing and again later near Kumhwa Pass -Its supporting artillery battery made contact at midnight after several hours march in darkness through mountains while two companies of infantry tried to follow on foot . It too met up below the pass where a roadblock had been established , but no prisoners taken excepting some wounded men who straggled across from their own lines.
2nd Brigade also suffered heavy casualties because all attempts by its other units, including an armored battalion commanded for about three-fourths hour before being relieved under fire or outflanked were unsuccessful against determined North Korean defenders trying desperately not only keep supplies moving forward toward Pyongyang and Seoul (capital) with reinforcements in support -but even more so protect them as far back into Korea behind Pusan Perimeter . 3rd Battalion arrived later that morning after over

At dawn, it was discovered that a gap had been opened between one company in contact near Mosan ni to another several hundred yards westward along Highway No-5 (Figure I ) which lay open for an enemy counterattack toward Munsangni or Taegu from Kumchon .
Throughout these days without sleeping more than three hours at time during operations against heavy odds - and with no communications except those obtained through air strikes ; artillery fire; small arms tracers fired over the heads of friendly forces on their way forward , or personally carried messages — 1st Battalion command post personnel were keyed up. They knew that any delay would be disastrous, but they could not move until contact was broken by ground combat troops near Mosan ni to reopen Highway No-5 between them (the battalion) in front northward toward Pukchinri and Kumchon .
In this operation as a whole—and particularly within its first two days -- the regimental commander's plan had worked well under stressful conditions : enemy counterattacks against exposed units ; lacking sleep for many hours at time; continuous rain with consequent muddy roads which made movement of equipment extremely difficult , if possible all — the 1st Battalion moved forward on schedule despite initial difficulties.

The Americans withdrew all along Kumsusan Beach by no later than midnight Saturday night/Sunday morning (September I8 /I S).
On Sunday afternoon they were still withdrawing up Route #7, but retreat became an orderly pullback around dusk as the North Koreans began pushing forward again after a rest period following ROK Army units southward out of Changnyong . By 10:3O PM it was over , leaving behind only corpses strewn among smoking ruins - literally thousands upon thousnmds and millions in US dollars worth oi'equipment. This is not to say that every American soldier killed or captured during this battle had been overcome by fear; many fought bravely until their death while others gave good account ol themselves under heavy fire before being taken prisoner (some even survived such captivity).
But for most Americans there were no happy endings here—just sorrowful ones instead." "The Battle Of Pusan Perimeter" will always be remembered as one of history’a greatest military victories ever achieved against overwhelming odds...and yet still lost! 😞

The men began moving at about midnight, but before they had gone more than halfway across no man's land there were several casualties from shelling ; these slowed down progress until just after daybreak when all units finally got into position on line with Able Rifles as far forward elements nearer enemy territory (see Map 2). D Company was not scheduled for combat that morning; it remained in reserve behind C Company . At first light Major Fussell sent a platoo n to the right of B and E Companies , which occupied positions astride Tae-dong village itself. This force consisted largely o f engineers who advanced slowly through streets litter ed wi th rubbish, debris fallen buildings, dead animals - anything but living men or horses ; they reached their objective at about noon without meeting any resistance except from snip ers firing upon them occasionally as if by way Of sport shooting on some range !
Able Rifles then moved forward into action against enemy troops located in several houses along this street . These were driven out with grenades after a short fight; the last house was cleared only when an officer of A Company , Lieutenant Gunnels (a veteran platoo n leader), rushed to it and personally fired his pistol through its door. This proved effective although he had not been authorized t o take such drastic measures, since later events showed that most Korean soldiers would surrender at first sight or sound - even from 50 yards away!

On this day, United Nations forces abandoned all positions northwestward along Route No-1 except for those near Chungchon where they held out throughout most of that month ; although scattered engagements continued until late in October almost no organized action took place after mid -September as both sides prepared their defensive lines and dug into new ones .
At dawn on June Seventh South Korean President Syngman Rhee ordered his army to attack North Korea , despite the fact he had previously stated publicly " If war breaks I will be a hostage with my people ". The next morning UN General Douglas MacArthur issued an ultimatum calling upon Kim Il Sungs government  (in Pyongyang ) for unconditional surrender within twenty four hours or face immediate invasion by United Nations forces ; although this order was technically directed at Kims military commanders, it also applied directly against him as commander in chief of all armed services and head o f state .
The following day June Eighth began Operation Glory (" Glorious Victories") under which USAF B -29 bombers struck North Korean positions around Seoul , Inchon Bay area ports such a s Chinnampo & Wonsan airfields along with other targets including rail lines between these cities; additionally MacArthurs ground troops advanced across the 38 th parallel towards Pyongyang but encountered fierce resistance from defending units who had been reinforced by several thousand Soviet advisers sent to aid their communist allies during this time period. The offensive was halted on July First after suffering heavy losses due mainly because of poor weather conditions combined w ith an effective enemy defense .

The enemy attack began with two battalions and five companies making landings to the northwest side while another company made a landing further south along Kamagusuku Bay.
Fortunately for I Corps it was not necessary because heavy artillery fire from 29th Infantry Division batteries near Seoul destroyed this bridge as well ; at first light November twenty-ninth, under orders issued during the night ( see map below ) US Eighth Army units attacked across No Gun Ri , quickly overwhelming ROK forces there without serious loss or damage; elements of D Company took Yongdok in an assault which lasted only two hours on December second .

At this point most survivors from these two divisions (including many prisoners) had been sent northwards into China and it was only at year’ s end that any significant numbers began arriving back down south as reinforcements or replacemenT units ; even then not enough to make up their losses in manpower since mid-July when UN forces recaptured Seoul .
The North Korean government officially claimed on November 20 th following the capture of Yongsan by U S troops : “ Our army has taken out five US regiments , destroyed over three hundred tanks, killed more than four thousand soldiers including General John H. Michaelis who commanded Task Force Smith ” (which included elements from all six Marine divisions ) and captured a total amount exceeded seven thouSand Americans while losing only about two thousands men itself during Operation Chromite – this despite being vastly superior numerically ; they also allegedly took with them almost one million dollars worth Of equipment which was then used against UN forces as part oF an intensive propaganda campaign to raise morale among its own people . 
This account is disputable because many of these figures cannot be verified due largely in large measure by lacking proper records on both sides since so much paperwork had been destroyed or lost altogether; nevertheless ,it does provide us some insight into just how badly things were going for North Korea at that point within their country’s history.

The trio began writing songs with no intention for them ever being heard by anyone outside their small circle in Ventura County California USA where all three lived / grew up or attended highschool nearby each other attending Buena High School ; the name "Hed" was chosen because it is an abbreviation of Head . They then recruited guitarist Travis Barker , who they knew from playing basketball and skateboard ramp jams on weekends ( he had played drums since age 7 ). Within two weeks Hed PE recorded its first demo which included six tracks including “ Killing Time ” & “ Dazam !” The band's second Demo, entitled One Word, featured four songs: Swan Song,”Far Too Young”, a cover version by Black Sabbath called ‘Children Of A Lesser God’ as well one other song titled "I Don`t Know". It was at this time that the group decided to drop their original drummer in favor of Travis Barker.
Their third and final Demotape contained only three cuts :“River Run Red”.  This particular tune became very popular on college radio stations across California . By late ’94 they had formed up with bassist Chizad ( Mark , not Matt) who also happened live near Ventura County & would attend many shows/events where he eventually met Mawk via a mutual friend named Chris “Kiddo” Coulson during one such event which took place while all four were attending Buena High School together ; shortly thereafter Hed PE made its first appearance performing at

Hed PE's debut album was recorded from October through November ; while it had been mixed since January, sideonedummy did not release any information about this new act until April 13th. This caused them some major criticism because they were known as an underground rap metal group which wasn't popular during their time period . On June twenty seventh , two days prior at the skatepark in Culver City California where <unk> and B-C Vaught grew up playing together regularly throughout most weekends - Hed performed with Fear Factory & Ministry on stage for one last show before breaking into music business forevermore!
In early September of that year (2005), " HED" was released by SideOneDummy Records to critical acclaim from both fans worldwide who had been waiting patiently ever since its release date arrived months earlier than expected. In October 13th, they toured North America alongside The Used . They then headlined their first tour across Europe between November thirtieth through December fifteenth; following this successful stint overseas , <unk> announced plans later in the month which would bring them back home once again during springtime next season !!!!!!

These vessels offer greater protection against enemy fire without sacrificing speed and maneuverability unlike previous designs which were limited by weight constraints imposed on them due to their traditional materials makeup i..e iron or steel plating surrounded wooden frames constructed from wood shipped overseas along with hull structures typically made out solid oak timber ( this allowed for easier repairs if damaged during battle ). <br /><a href="https://www.google

British ships first used steam engines as auxiliary power for their sailing rig in about 1765; by around this time, some small craft were also propelled entirely using enginepower insteadof or alongside oars and/or wind (see rowboat). The earliest known purpose built steampower naval vessel was a ferry boat on Lake Erie , launched near Pittsburgh Pennsylvania during the summer iffhg i g the year . It is said that it never actually saw use because of political machinations between two rival communities involved with its construction but there are no records to support such speculation.
In England an experimental ship called "the Flying Fish" began operating out from Plymouth Harbour in 1803; however, this did not lead directly towards development into warships as they were intended for trade rather than fighting purposes until much later when steamboats became more practical due largely through advances made by Robert Livingston Stephenson who patented his design aroundthis time period too although he died before seeing any commercial success come aboutfrom them . Another early example was HMS Gannet which had been built secretively at Chatham dockyard without anyone knowing what it looked like or how fast she could travel - only two years after her launch date! She remained unused because of problems with stability causedby being top-heavy but eventually found favour during peace negotiations between France and Britain in 1806 where both sides wanted an agreement that would end hostilities onceand for all so they sent representatives out onto the open sea aboard their respective vessels (Gannette & Le Phare) who signed off on terms later known collectiv

> it took until after Napoleonic Wars ended that a naval officer realized how much more powerful screw-driven vessels were than their predecessors. This led directly in Great Britain' s Royal Navy into an all out search by Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin (later Lord de Grey ) with his brother John Herschel leading, starting around June or July [ citation needed ]
and lasting three years which resulted eventually and very surprisingly as announced at Chatham Dockyard to shipbuilders as well engine buildrs alike . The results of this research came about from the need for speed without using sail power alone , but also stealthy operations that would allow ships like frigates & sloops-of war a chance against enemy navies on equal terms. By 1839 steam had become accepted in naval circles; by October HMS Aetna was trialed off Portsmouth Harbour with great success under her new propulsion system designed specifically based upon Herschel's designs, she could reach speeds exceeding ten knots and operated silently unlike any other vessel before it! This meant there were no more objections to building such vessels which began being commissioned into service shortly afterwards .
This led directly from this point until the end of WWI when all major world powers (except for Japan) used either screw or paddle driven ships exclusively as warships.

> idon has argued that these new warships altered navies' strategic choices, making them more reliant on their navy as an instrument with wide ranging political implications.
Warship designs were influenced by developments such as improvements made during trials and experiments conducted between wars; increased budgets allowed naval architects & designers time for innovation (evolving from sail power only). The size of fleets also changed significantly due to advances like torpedoes being introduced which meant ships had less armament but greater protection against attacking vessels so they could be used in larger numbers without fear @-@ retaliatory strikes resulting out damage suffered previously when smaller crews operated fewer weapons systems etcetera .  This change brought about a new era where warships became more important than ever before because there was now no longer any way around having one on hand if you wanted victory over another country' s forces.
The French Navy built two cruisers with screw propulsion and wood hulls, La Gloire (1859) & the Avril(1860). The first steel frigate launched by France came from Newcastle upon Tyne; she had an iron frame but wooden decking that could be replaced quickly after battle or as needed for repairs @-@ sea without loss of time waiting months away at dockyard facilities ashore like many warships were required to do previously under sail power only .  This new technology allowed them access into shallower waters where their previous vessels would have struggled due too lack availability suitable harbours close enough provide safe shelter against stormy weather conditions which often occurred during long ocean voyages.
The development continued with the adoption in Britain and other European navies, especially Germany's Kaiser Friedrich

This was still very fast for gun boats or other vessels with sails , however these ships had no armor protection that could resist projectiles fired from shore artillery because all weapons used by them consisted mostly cannons and rifles which required relatively light ammunition compared steel shells developed later in this era ; therefore their combat effectiveness against enemy land based defenses would be questionable .
The British built two floating batteries Glattonand Meteor each weighing about one thousand tons equipped with a single large central turret containing 40 guns on the main deck surroundedby side-wheel propulsion engines. They were designed to provide long range fire support for attacks upon Russian naval bases at Kronstadt, or other places where they could not get close enough without being attacked themselves first , but these plans never came into fruition because by that time newer and better ironclads had been invented which made them obsolete before their completion ; therefore both ships remained in reserve until sold off later during World War I when many old vessels from all over Europe needed quick cash .

> atic change in shipbuilding policy became necessary. In November, Admiral Jurien de la Gravière published an article entitled "The Future Battling Fleets", which argued strongly against any further construction by French yards outside Paris; instead he advocated concentrating all efforts into two or three large naval dockyards capable producing first-class vessels with modern armaments . He also called for new designs based on ironclad technology – these ships should be able not only defend themselves but use their guns as effectively at long range (especially if they were mounted high above deck) 
He predicted that such warships would soon dominate the seas , and France could ill afford to fall behind in this area.   His arguments proved persuasion, so a commission was formed under General Bressand de Saint Amant who proposed constructing four battleships of between six thousand tons displacement armed all overwith powerful heavy caliber breech loading artillery weapons using both rifled cannons with explosive shells .

The first ocean going armored cruiser had been launched on September the previous year but as there were no turrets she did not fit into any category that could be considered 'modern'. The next major naval development would have come from Britain who put one onto their pre dreadnought battleship HMS Inflexible which displaced around double of what Gloire's predecessors carried at a time when tonnage was used rather than mass or weight in ship design although it is true they came close for several decades to 1860 . Her appearance prompted other navies such has Spain and Italy building similar vessels over following years before being superseded by modern armored cruisers during World War I.
Gloire' s success led France, Great Britian , Russia & Germany all racing against eachother build more gun power into these new designs so soon there were hundreds built worldwide making them some if not the most numerous warship type ever produced until WWII which saw even greater numbers constructed due largely because many countries had little choice but spend large amounts on naval construction rather than going head long toward air supremacy or mechanized ground forces as seen later in 20th century wars such Syria .

The Admiralty decided that one ironclad should be built at Chatham Dockyard , while two more were ordered in July ; the first ship was given the name Black Prince after a previous battleship of this class which had been scrapped . In May 1870 work on three ships started simultaneously : Warrior for Portsmouth Royal Naval Yard (RNY), Iron Duke for Devonport R. Nay,and Caesar to build alongside Gloire under construction by Laird Brothers Ltd., Birkenhead as part-payment from France and Germany respectively; these latter vessels became Agincourt when transferred later onto British registry

The introduction @-@of compounds into gunpowder led to an increase both muzzle velocity as well explosive strength , which meant that naval guns could now fire shell shots instead just solid shot . This change necessitated a rethinking of armour design : where before protecting thicknesses were concentrated on the hull plating, they would need spread throughout more area in order provide effective protection from high calibre projectiles at long range firing conditions. In addition it became clear how difficult such large vessels with thin sidewalls might be made vulnerable by splinters thrown off when struck; these problems only grew worse if enemy ships also had heavier weapons mounted upon their decks!
The first iron-clad battleship to enter service was HMS Warrior , which launched 1860 and completed after some delays . She carried a main armament of sixteen guns ( twelve pivoting rifled muzzle loaders ) ; however, the ship' s overall design proved flawed because she could not maintain sufficient speed under steam power alone without incurrin g excessive strains on her machineries or risk damaging them. The next year saw an improvement: two boilers were added onto each side while still retains four large funnels for ventilation purposes only; this allowed warships like HMS Devastation come into existence with eight engines total but capable reaching speeds up to 18 knots when fully loaded down wi th ammunition

These vessels, which included USS Constellation – whose launch was attended personally by President Thomas Jefferson - would be deployed against Confederate forces; they proved too small for modern naval battles such as Fort Sumter or Port Royal Sound
The first use of an armored ship in action came on March  6th    . The CSS Virginia — a former U.S.-built ironclad casemated steamship  converted into the flagship at Hampton Roads , Va., after being burned out while under construction—attacking Union ships off Newport News Point near Norfolk (Virginia) with guns from her ram bow, sank USS Cumberland and seriously damaged two other wooden frigates - Congress & Minnesota – before she was disabled by another vessel's shell hitting one of its boilers which exploded causing it to be scuttled
On May    8th      2015 an armored ship in action came when CSS Virginia attacked U.S.-flagged merchant vessels attempting   passage through Charleston harbor .  The next day , the Confederate ironclad retreated upriver after a bombardment caused significant damage onboard; this marked both sides first use naval artillery against eachother during hostilities (i e : war at sea) between nations within modern times period known as "The American Civil War"(which lasted from April   63rd year until June     947).

 This action is considered one if the first modern battleship vs. ironclad duels ever fought out anywhere around worldwide where both ships were using guns against another ship (iron plate) rather than cannon shots or missiles fired directly at targets from a distance; thus making it more strategic and tactical compared to previous wars involving wooden vessels used before then during earlier eras when warships relied heavily upon firepower alone instead of defense mechanisms such as armor plating etc., resulting in higher casualties among sailors crews due lower level protection provided by traditional materials like wood versus newer steel-based designs which allowed them greater flexibility while also providing superior durability under heavy combat situations without breaking apart easily .
  However, the Manasses was soon followed up with other similar projects over time until eventually there were enough ships available for both sides that battles could be fought between ironclads regularly throughout this period; some notable examples include: The CSS Virginia against USS Cumberland (1862), where one vessel sank another completely after sustaining severe damage during their engagement ; Or even more recently , when U S Navy Battlestar Galactica encountered an enemy fleet led by Commander

After repairs in Norfolk for two months (the CSS Richmond had been captured during that time), she returned north under new commander Raphael Semmes who led her into Mobile Bay where it engaged a Federal blockading squadron of five sailing vessels; although seriously outgunned by its opponents' more numerous cannons with heavier balls, including those fired at long range on an upward trajectory through clouds , Monitor managed to drive off or sink all but one Union ship while suffering only superficial damage and the loss of three men .
  A second battle between ironclads took place later when Virginia confronts USS Cumberland in Hampton Roads. Again badly damaged after two hours fighting alongside another wooden warship (the Congress), she was finally overwhelmed despite several attempts made during daylight periods for repairs underway ; however they proved futile against superior firepower from hostiles whose guns were much larger than hers had been designed originally as those intended solely for use on land rather than naval combat operations at sea due mainly because their muzzles pointed skyward instead down towards targeted vessels below surface level like submarines do today .
  The Confederates continued to build more ironclad ships, but by the end of March both sides knew that these new weapons could not be relied upon. In April and May there would only one engagement between two armored warships: a brief clash near Charleston Harbor in which Monitor damaged CSS Chicora , while another ship was being built nearby; it did no damage however so this battle didn't count either way toward victory or defeat!

Therefore, although these events have been described as 'one sided', it should be noted that this was only true for most part during nighttime when no real shots could ever take place between opposing ships or boats (although some sources say otherwise). 2019

At any rate, despite several attempts on all parts they could not get their ships alongside one another for boarders to cross over from ship-to -ship or even come near enough together so that an enemy captain might surrender his vessel after having had it fired into ; many hours passed with neither side gaining anything . The two fleets manoeuvred back towards each other until finally at 4 p m both sides came within range and began exchanging fire — but only very little damage resulted , as during these engagements too much smoke covered everything making the gunnery difficult; also most of those shots which did hit caused no serious harm.
The Italians tried in vain several times throughout this engagement (and again later) to get alongside their adversaries for boarders, while on every occasion they were driven away by heavy gunfire from cannon that had been placed along-side ships' decks so close together it was impossible not even with small arms firing! The Austrian flagship , despite her best efforts failed twice before finally managing at 6 p m .to ram a Italian vessel and sink another — but she herself suffered very severe damage as well when struck repeatedly between the hulls during these attempts ; also two other vessels of hers sank without being able or allowed time enough either because too much smoke covered everything making gunnery difficult; furthermore many shots did no harm to enemy targets due mainly owing again mostly thanks be given heaven for this fact solely caused by great luck & providence rather than skill alone which would have been impossible otherwise.

> warships, particularly those that followed them. It was after these engagements (especially during their second phase) when both navies realized how vulnerable wooden hulled ships could be to high explosive shells fired from rifle-type guns mounted aboard ship or shore batteries; an armament which soon became commonplace across all major powers' fleets once gun technology had progressed sufficiently for large bore weapons capable firing such rounds with reasonable accuracy over long ranges in a seaborne environment . As well as ironclad battleships , coastal defence artillery began developing into formidably powerful weapon systems - even larger than those of the warships themselves – able not only destroy enemy vessels but also bombarded them while at anchor. This development would lead directly towards World War I and its massive fleet engagements, whereby vast numbers (sometimes hundreds) ships were sunk on both sides by shellfire alone; an event which until then was unthinkable given that wooden hull construction had been considered impregnabl

Iron-hulled warships armed with heavier caliber weapons could still be damaged or sunk by a well aimed gunshot : USS Monitor's loss in March,1862 demonstrated this fact and it is one reason why many historians consider her battle against CSS Virginia (ex USS Merrimack) as decisive for naval combat tactics during WWII - this despite being lost after just 3 hours of fighting .
The first modern battleship ever built , HMS Dreadnought was launched on February the First nineteen hundred & sixteen ; she carried four turrets mounting eight guns each instead off dozens o f smaller caliber weapons. The combination if long range fire power coupled with heavier armor meant that enemy ships could be sunk without resort to ramming or boardin g and made large scale engagements a thing from past history: in fact most major navies adopted some form ' d dreadnot' design within decade, though not all did so equally rapidly - one such nation being Japan which remained loyal till late into World War I .
The battle of Jutland saw 16 German warships lost , but only two were actually hit by shells fired at them while the rest either ran out fuel / ammunition before they had been damaged beyond repair (for example HMS Black Prince), escaped after sustaining light damage themselves. These factors combined with superior tactics on part British commanders ensured victory over larger enemy fleet despite their numerical disadvantage ; this was considered a major blow to morale among Imperial Germany' s population who felt betrayed when news reached home about what happened off coast Norway last May eighteen hundred & seventy-five - an event known as Skagerrakschlacht .

The guns could still fire far faster than a ship @-@ s speed at any given moment so only one or two hits on an unarmored part had to be successful for damage 
to occur; additionally their high velocity made them difficult targets even with modern gun turrets which allowed gunners some measure of protection . When ships did meet in combat the ram was often used simply because both sides wanted victory but there is no evidence that either side expected anything other then being struck by another vessel's bow first before attempting further maneuvers against each others broadside , as it would have been impossible without risking hitting something else instead (such cases were rare). In short while rams could indeed do great harm when they connected successfully - such collisions rarely occurred due primarily too bad weather conditions resulting from stormy seas 
-they weren’t effective weapons during actual engagements between two opposing fleets given how quickly guns needed ammunition reloads versus what time elapsed for an enemy ship @@ to move out of range after ramming one . Ultimately this made them obsolete but not until well into World War II did any navy actually remove all its warships with bows armed by these devices. The most famous example remains HMS Dreadnought which launched in November,1906 and featured no fewer than ten forward firing cannon (including three massive sixteen inches). But even though it was designed specifically around the idea that rams were now useless - since they had been rendered impotent due too advances

The Royal Navy'S first experimentation of its own with turreted warships came during construction at Chatham Dockyard on HMS Captain (launch date April Fools Day) designed under Admiral John Haynes 's direction using sophisticated steam driven pumping machinery to create buoyancy chambers that enabled her plates not merely be laid over the top hull which was constructed entirely in wood . This provided for a complete immunity from shellfire as well reducing weight , increasing speed by 10 knots or more and lower draught but also cost an additional £85,269.
In December he decided upon another ship with steel armour all round albeit only two inches thick and built at Portsmouth Dockyard on HMS Devastation (launched July Fools Day) who's trials revealed how vulnerable she still would have been against rifled cannon firing explosive projectiles because of her thinness to firepower ratio despite the strengthened hull which enabled greater speeds . In February Haynes ordered a third turret warship from Armstrong in Newcastle-upon -Tyne , named Warspite for launching 31 March although not completed until June; this was then followed by Black Prince launched May with building continuously interrupted due partly but mainly owning to labour disputes at Chatham Dockyard.
In early September 20th century battleships had replaced ironclads as main capital ships, and were being built

Admiral Lord Dundonald, who commanded some early triremes at Balaklava during Crimean War wrote that 'The great difficulty now is not so much fighting them as getting near enough; for when once they are engaged with you nothing can save either ship'. 
  17th century French naval officer Antoine-René de Troyareported on a meeting between British officers he had encountered and American sympathisers: "I was told by the English themselves of their difficulties against ships armed only in iron , but without guns . They said it would be impossible to fight such vessels unless one could get within twenty paces. I think this must have been true, because if these two hundred tons [of ram] did not sink some vessel which weighed five or six times more than itself there is no doubt that she inflicted considerable damage."
In fact most sinking occurred at ranges much further away from each other (120–365 yards) as opposed t othe 8-yard range suggested above and required a great deal less effort on part of th eattacking ship's crew: see the article 'ramming in naval warfare'.

It was also noted during this period how difficult it had been for sailing warships, even those mountings multiple heavy cannon and having large crews that manned them at great risk from enemy fire while their own ship continued moving under way or close hauled - just as effective modern gunfire is delivered by single , relatively lightly armed soldiers who operate machine-guns mounted permanently aboard stationary aircraft .

The useable range for these weapons is limited because they are not equipped with rifling inside their barrel, instead relying solely upon expansion as a means or propulsion and accuracy; this allows them greater flexibility when dealing against light fortifications but makes it difficult to hit moving targets over any distance beyond about one kilometer (0·62 mi). Their low rate of fire also limits usefulness at longer ranges: only 15 rounds per minute can be delivered from Armstrong's weapon while Hotchkiss could manage just six . While both have been found suitable in coastal defense roles , the lackluster performance @@_@@- of these weapons during World War I resulted ~~~~in a change towards breech loading designs which are able more easily adapt new types o f ammunition and offer higher rates offire.
At first glance, this type appears similar but its main distinction is that it uses an explosive charge to drive projectile out into space instead requiring gunpowder propellant like traditional artillery shell (known as "experimental" or sometimes simply referred too). This makes them ideal for use against targets such airplanes because they can be fired at relatively low angles without overpenetrating . Although effective in their intended role , the high cost of these weapons has prevented widespread adoption by militaries around world who prefer cheaper alternatives with less risk involved ~~~~and more reliable performance when compared 1906s models.

The German Navy regarded the British as potential adversaries , whereas Britain viewed Russia similarly in its eastern possessions such East Africa ( Kenya ) & Tanganyika / Tanzania ). A key factor behind this policy of naval armament competition between these two countries is their geographical proximity ; although they are separated only slightly along a line drawn from Denmark through northern Norway into northwestern Sweden there exist major differences :
1) Both nations have large territories but differ greatly with respects size; while both share similar coastlines, one country has much greater land mass than another. 2). Germany had been defeated by France at Waterloo during Napoleonic Wars and therefore suffered humiliation which led many Germans to seek vengeance against French people . On the other hand , Britain was victorious over Napoleon III in Crimean War (1854-6 ) so did not feel compelled towards any particular action vis – à -vis their neighbour across Channel until later date when they became aware of Prussian ambitions for expansion into Europe & beyond via colonisation efforts begun under Otto von Bismarck’s administration between late nineteenth century onwards through creation two colonial empires namely German East Africa / Tanzania followed soon afterwards by acquisition Southwest African colony

> actically, naval warfare developed into what is now known and understood today. The broadside became obsolete for any ship over about two hundred feet (60 metres) long because it took too much time - even if all guns were pointed forward or sideways at once; this resulted from both changes to artillery design that made them more accurate while firing larger shells as well the greater distance between ships due mainly outgrowing of wooden hull designs in favour metal ones during World War I period when they started becoming equipped w/o sailors onboard anymore & later began using steel instead iron which was easier maintain than before .
As a result, armored cruisers emerged along with battleships. These new types could fire their big cannons accurately enough for 20 miles (35 km), and even further away if there were no targets or obstacles blocking line-of sight; hence why these vessels became known simply “cruiser”. The term itself originally meant something else though: A lightly armed ship whose main role involved convoy protection against pirates who would otherwise attack merchant ships carrying goods across oceans from one country into another without any sort of defense whatsoever – they’d also be tasked w/ protecting ports & harbors located within coastal regions around world too!

It is not easy today, with modern materials available that are stronger than the iron of those days or even steel alloys like Krupp's High Chrome Steel developed by Friedrich Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach starting at around this time ,to imagine what these big naval cannons must have done when fired from a ship into another vessel . I think there was one battle where some British warships attempted an attack upon Jutland in 1905 using their huge guns but it failed miserably as they had to fire over open sights and thus were very difficult targets indeed ! The shell could easily miss its target entirely (which would be quite easy considering how far away you are firing)or worse still hit something else completely different which wasn’t meant for any harm.
The "Big Guns" of the Royal Navy, also known by other names such as large calibre artillery or long range weapons systems , have been used since at least World War II . They can consist either solely within naval vessels themselves like battleships / cruisers/ destroyer class ships OR attached directly onto shore based installations via floating platforms & rails that allow them to fire while afloat in water depths too deep otherwise requiring specialised equipment only available with submarines !

This led to poor maneuverability but good protection against other such vessels - with both gunfire damage control systems at that time being less than effective, it would be necessary for an attacker's shell or shot (gunshot) to hit either directly below deck level where there is no structural support from which projectiles can ricochet back into the ship as well its main vertical supports in order for penetration by direct fire weapons like guns 
 To counteract these deficiencies and reduce weight while providing better performance during sea trials was attempted , giving rise later on a new type of ironclad design called " central battery ships ." These were notably used most prominently aboard USS Monitor with her turret-mounted gun. This trend continued throughout history until around World War I, when steel plate armor became too heavy to be practical or efficient enough without great loss off efficiency due largely because it took so much effort just keep upkeep going (i e., manpower). The final form this would take involved having multiple decks below deck level filled entirely by either guns pointing outwards at enemy targets across open space; these vessels also employed modern weaponry such as torpedos mounted inside their hulls which could destroy large ships from underneath them if they were not properly protected against attacking submarines! 
 In contrast , the Japanese battleship Nagato carried her main battery in two rows and thus was called a " double-deck ironclad" . This provided better protection but less fire power than broadside designs.

It proved that it could be operated without an exposed crew; both sides lost men because they did so regardless ; this led many nations into building similar ironclads for use during World War I when mobile fortifications became important defensive weapons (the German bunker line being one example). Some warships had only half-turrets or no tower at all but were still protected from enemy fire due their armour plates covering them completely except where gunports opened onto open decks behind which crews hid themselves while manning guns inside those ports..
In 1862 the British launched HMS Iron Duke with its high prow and low stern. In contrast to other vessels of her type, she was not equipped on either end: instead they placed two large funnels amidship that provided much better ventilation than if both ends would have been closed off as usual by a "pig iron" belly (a narrow passageway running through each side). The only weapon used against these ships were small cannon balls fired from long range at their sides; otherwise there wasn't anything capable enough yet available for use aboard any ship until after WWII when submarines became commonplace during wartime operations underwater!
The first turreted warships began appearing in the 1860s, and it took another decade before all major navies had adopted them. It was not uncommon to find one- or two -gun armaments on some vessels designed as light cruisers which could easily be replaced by larger guns if needed later down line due military necessity such cases occurred regularly throughout both World Wars where battleships were often retrofitted with bigger weaponry than originally planned upon completion because

One solution was given at this time : using gun barbettes instead; these could mount one heavy rifled cannon pointing forward (as well as being used for secondary weapons) while allowing room enough behind it where several smaller pivoting lighter calibre guns mounted sideways facing outwards from each broadside flanked their heavier counterparts . This design allowed better overall protection against enemy fire because all of its weaponry would be protected by armor plating around them which made hitting any target difficult even if they were stationary due to having no moving parts on board except those necessary just like how modern battleships are constructed today with large turrets and multiple decks below deck level offering similar levels safety when under attack during combat operations at sea!

The American Civil War saw two designs for revolving guns; one was a modified Coles type while another used an Ericsson style barbette design .

A second problem with turrets is their vulnerability from above : unlike casemates which can only fire downwards through openings below decks; all guns on board have to remain pointed upward while inside a vertical structure like those aboard USS Passaic . The lack of gun ports also means the ships were unable 1863'S armour was thin and light compared against later designs , but even so it protected her crew well enough that they could still fight off Confederate attacks until late in battle when she ran out ammunition ( see Battle for Hampton Roads ) In fact ; ironclad warships at this time weren’t particularly suited towards fighting other vessels due largely because no one had yet thought about what makes an effective battleship design; instead most navies simply focused on having more guns than anyone else without worrying too much if those weapons would actually hit anything once fired .
On the whole however Ericsson did make some important contributions to naval architecture during his lifetime including inventions such as screw propeller , conning tower/bridge structure and watertight compartments.

With no doubt you are right that there is nothing new about an ironclad being built on wooden hull lines as we can see from your examples above (I'm particularly impressed by CAPTAIN). However I think my question concerns vessels whose primary purpose when constructed were warships rather than merchantmen or steam yachts such those which have been mentioned earlier and of course HMSS Warrior & Victory themselves .

With increasing size came greater range, but still these weapons were considered too small to threaten a capital ship unless launched from shore or another vessel; however their effect on wooden vessels was devastating when successful and led many navies with such ships (such as Russia) into arming them for self defense in depths which would not be reached until after armored warships became commonplace . By this time , there existed two types : fixed charge 
torpillos (or 'tubular torpedoes') that required manual handling outside of combat ; they could only reach distances between one hundred yards away due mainly because most had limited power compared @-@ the modern ones we use today - but also an early version made by Germany during World War I called Unterseeboot Type U1 or Turtle Shell was able to travel upwards off its launcher before going underwater again once it found a target; however these were too costly and not very reliable so those who tried them ended with no success at all .

As late as 1862, Britain' s admiral Sir John Holloway recommended that every warship should have "a proportion" @-@% [of] timber for the sake o~f buoyancy , a view shared by others like French naval engineer Henri Dupuy de Lôme who stated: “I believe in iron ships ... but I also know they will never be able to replace wooden ones entirely.” He later added : ”They must always remain auxiliary vessels” . The British navy had been using wood extensively since Nelson’s time and was slow on adopting new materials such ~as steel or wrought -iron. In 1875, an Admiralty report concluded that even if all shipbuilders used only softwood (pine), it would take three years just for the supply of timber needed o~r one battleship !
The German admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , who became head @-@% [of] Kaiser Wilhelm II' s naval department in May i90o after a period as commander at sea said: “I cannot believe there will ever be any ships built without iron” .

The US Navy adopted Harvey' s system at about this time but switched after finding it too heavy even though they did not go as far into naval architecture innovations such us using rivets instead o f nails to build their hulls more quickly than ever before or building lighter warships that could carry larger guns by making them longer rather th an wider like the USS Texas class battleships were designed because she was faster in spite her large size , which made up for being slower under steam power alone compared with previous designs due largely tp having less internal volume . She also had smaller crews, so fewer men would have been required per ship; however these advantages came wi thin cost: armor thickness decreased from 20 inches (51 cm) on earlier vessels down below ten feet deep while still providing protection against heavy artillery fire at close range even though this meant sacrificing some speed over distance travel distances during combat operations where long-range gunfire could be used effectively without worry about enemy ships coming within reachable striking radius unless they were very fast moving targets themselves

 20th century submarines had two screw propellers (one for each shaft) but used electric motors rather than steam engines, and so were not hybrid designs. The first such design intended solely or primarily with the use of diesel power , however is said [by whom?]to be that developed by John Holland at his yard on New York City ' s East River from about  1935-48; this has been called " Holland Hybrids ". It consisted essentially in using an external combustion engine as prime mover driving one crankshaft via a gearbox which was mounted between it and its own reduction drive to turn both screw propellers . 
 Some modern submarines have two independent sets each including electric motor/generators plus batteries (see below) so can operate silently without surfacing but are not true hybrid designs.

In October she became part of an experimental squadron including two other ships that proved adequate at speeds upwards off twenty knots (26 mph; forty km/h) on steam alone without resorting back onto sail powered rigging or sails ; however it would be until November before any member could attain over thirty-two miles per hour under both modes combined in one vessel and thus no longer need to rely solely upon their traditional method .
By 1879 , the British fleet's newest battleship HMS Dreadnought was fully armed with fourteen -inch guns as opposed too @ earlier designs which had only carried eight inches weapons !

Certainly there were other factors that influenced this decision apart form tactical considerations - not least cost: but on balance one has t o conclude tha~t by early August Admiral Jellicoe was thinking seriously about converting his fleet over-all (not just a small group) completely and exclusively onto coal fired power plants; thus he initiated action to have all his battleships fitted . By October , however, when faced with an enemy who appeared likely at any moment lo advance into the North Sea it became apparent that such conversions would take too long ; moreover they could be completed only if steam coaling stations of sufficient capacity existed along 'the route from Scapa Flow.
Within weeks these plans were shattered for good: on 1 November the Germans sank three British battle cruisers in one go - including Jellicoe's flagship HMS Invincible (ironically this ship had been a major influence upon him) and th e fleet was forced to withdraw back towards its base . At sea there now lurked an enemy who possessed both superior technology with respect t o his underwater craft, as well ~as tactical expertise; clearly he would not be deterred by any naval blockade , or even b y having all of Britain 'a~ttackable from afar. The only hope for Admiral Hiilicove lay at Scapa Flow ; if the German High Seas Fleet came out into open waters then it could lose control over events in order that history might repeat itself - although this time on a much grander scale and more destructive fashion than ever before seen !

The Russian Navy had already realized that it needed more efficient warships than its wooden frigates could offer ; in fact, they were not even fast enough against their European rivals' ironclad battleships and corvettes armed wi th breechload ers (the new Krupp cannon).

This design became commonplace as it offered good speed with economical coal consumption ; although there had been some experimentation before this time many naval architectures believed that high speeds would be impracticable on large vessels without using expensive fuel such as oil or alcohol so they concentrated their efforts into improving efficiency rather than increasing performance .  By World War I most navies were operating ships equipped only for conventional sailing operations; however the Royal Navy continued to build small numbers of steam-powered warships until after WWII ended in Europe (1938). In addition, during both world wars US navy operated several hundred diesel powerd auxiliary cruisers which could outrun any surface ship at sea but lacked armament suitable against submarines except when escorted by destroyer squadrons.
Despite these advances it was not possible before then either due largely because there had been no major conflicts since Trafalgar where naval tactics remained unchanged , nor did they anticipate future threats like aircraft carriers .  The development phase lasts approximately two centuries from the first recorded example of a warship propelled solely or primarily using steam engines in Mayfair England until about  1860; however some scholars believe that this period began much earlier around   27 BC with Heron' s screw paddlewheel ship designs being developed during Roman times (see also: History Of Ships ).
The end date for these developments has not yet reached its conclusion but it seems likely given current trends towards green technologies and alternative fuels such as nuclear power plants which may eventually replace fossil fuel based ones like oil .  This makes sense because

> ousands more men served aboard wooden-hulled gunboats that supported operations ashore during this period. These craft varied from shallow draft steamers ( sometimes with auxiliary sail rigs ) used on rivers, to ocean going ironclads able only under favorable conditions in heavy weather; they were very active participants at the bombarding sieges carried out by both sides along coastal areas throughout much of Europe and Asia . The navy was divided into three groups: battleships or battle cruisers , armored ships which are now known as " capital vessels" for naval historians because their primary purpose is not commerce protection but rather fighting other navies ; protected warships such 
as torpedo boats destroyer s etc.; finally gunboats also called ' submarines' ( a term that later came about from confusion with British usage). Some modern experts argue there should be one more group consisting only of auxiliary craft like tugs & tenders; however this idea has been rejected by most professional maritime writers including those who work on shipboard operations in today’s navy . In addition to these types, many non-naval units operated independently under military control throughout much <unk> European conflicts involving armored vessels. These included riverine forces based at ports along riverside cities such as Amsterdam 
or London ; naval infantry divisions used for garrisoning coastlines or landing parties during amphibious assault s etc.; and specialized commando squadrons formed from volunteer sailors trained specifically how attack fortifications ashore ( e.,g..

But by 1870, naval technology made such plans obsolete ; to sink or disable one' s opponent without losing oneself required armor protection and heavy guns mounted aboard relatively large vessels capable
of sustained speeds greater than their targets ( see "torpedoboot" ). The first ironclad warship designed specifically for battle against other ships was HMS Warrior , launched on March I4th . It displaced about twice as much tonnage @-@ laden with her full complement of weapons compared wi th the previous largest British battleship - a vessel called Royal Sovereign which had been laid down in 1859 but not completed until September, II. To be fair to those who built RS she did have one advantage over WA: Her length and beam were each more nearly equal; this gave greater stability at sea than would otherwise result from having too little or very long keel lines (see "sloops" for details). But still Warrior' s dimensions made it possible
to carry heavier armament plus extra crew members needed just like modern destroyers do today when escorting aircraft carriers through dangerous waters! Ironclad ships of the early period typically carried four heavy guns , two on either side . These may well explain why some naval historians prefer calling these vessels battleships instead because they had many similarities w/the later ones built during World Wars I & II.

These dimensions limited both range @speedand weight capacity , which were below those required by modern standards even though they still exceeded requirements during World War I era ( see Table II ) ********. Also important was their low cruising radius due to lacking coal storage capacities compared with other battleships or armored ships ; this problem became particularly acute when operating at higher speeds.
The Devastation class's main purpose would have been coastal defence, but it could also be used as a scout vessel and support ship in more distant waters since its speed allowed her reaching Bermuda unescorted without relying on outside help . In addition she had sufficient endurance for long distance voyages; however , these advantages were offset by certain drawbackssuchas being unableto carry out offensive operations against enemy shipping because of their small sizeand not possessing any self propelled guns which gave them insufficient range @speedfor effective service away from home bases ( see Table III ) ********.

In 1870 , the Royal Navy converted two small wooden paddle steam frigates (HMS Aetna & Sirius) into 'water monitor type' vessels.
The last generation were known as coastal defence ships, which had a much more powerful armament than their predecessors but still carried relatively light guns ; they usually displaced over twice what these earlier classes did and could be classified either by being built to designs intended for merchant ship conversions or through adherence with British Admiralty design requirements; examples include HMS Shannon was an iron-hulled screw gunboat of 345 tons launched in January ,1862 . In March she took part at the bombardment on Fort Pickens ( Florida ) during American Civil War : her crew lost one man killed.

This newfound strength would then be put on display through multiple conflicts where successive victories over foreign enemies helped cement Japan's position within Asia during late 19th century until early part of next one ( World War I).

As with many technological transitions in history, some countries tried out new designs while others continued building old types.

However by then most navies had moved onward into using dreadnought type vessels or semi -dreadnaught sized ships as their main capital ship design , although they often used monitors to accompany the fleet along coasts where mines were a threat ; these ironclads nevertheless remained popular through World War I because of cheaper cost compared @-@

"After Blenheim", although considered one long verse novel and with some internal rhymes such as 'heaven/Hell', does have traditional ballad stanzas of six lines . In the first half , these stanza form is used for several poems whereby a single narrator or character recounts an event that has occurred to him ; at times this may be biographical, but more often than none they deal in general thematic material about life itself. However after around thirty versed there appears another structure consisting entirely without any sort use whatsoever; instead it takes place over multiple scenes which were not necessarily related either chronologically nor geographially speaking : " A Soldier' s Tale" being one example here 
This change marks something significant within Hardy 's writing because he no longer simply wanted his poetry sole collection read individually , as before . Instead now readers would have had access through publication process those various different sections of poems into separate volumes ( some called novels) whereby each could be bought separately from others thus providing more options when choosing how much money spend !

Therefore the poem can be seen more accurately within its historical context rather than being viewed solely through modern eyes: during World War II , people did not have access to mass media such i s television or radio, so it was important that they read newspapers ; therefore poetry often carried political messages. This is why some critics believe Eliot used very simple words like “war” because he wanted readers who had never experienced war before (such as those living under Nazi rule) understand his message . The most powerful images are also found at t h e end of each stanza; this shows us how serious and dramatic these events really were for him personally 
At the time when "The Waste Land" appeared in print form there weren't many other works which could be considered modernist literature since traditional forms such s sonnets or ballads dominated poems written during that period ; however , after its publication writers began experimenting with new techniques including stream-of consciousness narration so now we have more variety within our literary genres than ever before!  7. ________ "This is what I want: not death but to know you."

The title may refer both directly (to little gids) or indirectly ("little iddings")—both pronunciations are acceptable according Daniel O'Quinn, who states: "'Gid', 'gidge': two dialect forms for `cottage'. This suggests Eliot’s own version in which ‘Lithe-tle Gudding,’ is not only homophonous to litre/liter but also echoes Old English gutan . … to dwell.'

Others have suggested the poem as a microcosm of life and death; that it represents eternity rather than time. The closing lines do seem somewhat ephemeral or at least they point towards this notion through their use by Virdee : "Time present ... future" (Eliots line 124) with his conclusion: "...we are here, we know how little while / We hold our part." Also in terms of human experience , Eliot seems very keen on using fire motifs ; these include - Burnt Norton(1935), Fire Sermon,(Four Quartets)(-all written during the same period as Little Gidding). This may be a reflection that all experiences will eventually die out.
It has also been suggested to symbolise eternity and rebirth . The poem is seen not only by some scholars but critics too who believe it encapsulates "the journey through time" (Jeremy Noel Merchant) or even more simply, "...a generalisation about life", according Daniel O'Quinn , 48th edition of 'The New Princeton Encyclopedia Of Poetry & poetics'.

 = Overall , " Little Gidding" deals with the idea of sacrifice, which includes both physical acts (such like martyrdom) but more importantly psychological ones too; this latter aspect involves letting go oe control over your life- whether that means accepting death as an option for yourself instead if you feel stuck somewhere between here & now where things seem hopeless because there isn't anything left worth fighting fpr anymore.

Eliot uses images from both mythology (Greek)—the Pythian priestess in Delphi who consultes Apollo through prophecy —and Christian tradition - Saint Augustine ' s Confessions of Faith ; a passage on faith which says that even when man losates his way he can find it again .
The title refers to St Nicholas church near Burwell Cambridgeshire where TS Elliott was married and also the name for one , or several small villages located between Cambridge, England  The poem is divided into five sections. Little Gidding contains three stanzas written by each poet respectively: Charles Eliot Norton – "Preludes" (1876); Ezra Pound; Louis MacNeice in turn writing about Pembroke College Oxford's Society Club which met at this address from October  24th through November   30 th of every year since its establishment on January first nineteen hundred six .
The second part consists solely off verse composed during his travel throughout Europe : Florence Italy ; Paris France and finally London UK where he died February seventeenth eighteen eighty-nine aged sixty seven years old  As with all poems within the Four Quartets , Little Gidding contains several biblical references including those made by John Donne concerning "Burnt Offerings" – a poem Eliot translated in early twenties. He also refers to Saint Augustines Confessions which speaks about faith, hope & charity being three great gifts that mankind should embrace:  1 Corinthians XV; Isaiah XLVII–XLIXXXI .

This ambiguity helps reinforce Eliot’s idea of a person being able 2 go through various stages within life before reaching salvation. This concept can relate heavily too how one could feel lost inside themselves but also know there'll always b hope if they keep looking forward towards better days ahead no matter what happens during those dark moments where everything seems bleak & hopeless ; this theme resonates deeply with me because I believe everyone experiences periods when nothing makes sense anymore& sometimes u don't have any clue which way is up!

This poem ends by stating that even though it may seem like Prufrock has failed at helping himself or anyone else through life 2 date , he still believes God will redeem him one day if only humanity stops fighting against each other so much . The last lines speak directly towards readers: "you who would be a poet must feel for what you are and get rid of all hope" (Eliot).

The principal technical difficulties are two : firstly how does one convey realism (in its widest sense) with absolute clarity? Secondary ly what do you mean by 'real' or even true reality ? My solution here has been both simple [and] complex. Simply because there isn’t anything else that will serve ; for if we make up something more imaginary than life itself , then the poem is an empty thing and no good . 17 Although it took him a long time he had arrived in late December, after "a month of feverish work" at his brother Herbert ’s house where
he was staying to recover from illness; this may have helped Eliot overcome some difficulties but also could be one reason why Little Giddi ng did not receive its first publication until April The fourth section of Four Quartets (which includes lines like these) has been called by critics: A great success... But I think that there are many passages which cannot bear comparison with anything else written or unwritten. It is the only passage within my experience - and no doubt other people' s too-in poetry , prose fiction etc., in painting, music ... 18 In October Edward Mendelson said he thought it "very beautiful" because while reading his mind was filled for a moment “with an ecstasy as if you were looking at some lovely object on your own .” He found Little Gidding to be about nothing but its title; however Eliot had told him earlier than day: The poem does not describe any particular place called 'Little gid d ing '; rather...it describes certain things which happen there (or anywhere) [such] that we may

Forster was especially upset at this point : "[ T]he ' I heard you patient fury ' has always made me sick ; not because the poet thinks himself above us all but precisely because it seems to imply we are below him and should be grateful if any of our little pains find their way into a poem ." For more on Waugh , see Hugh Walpole in chapter 41 [ page needed ] Eliot took issue for several years afterward (particularity from about March, ) over what he felt as being an unjustified attack by Scruton. In response Eustace Mullins wrote that " This is Mr Roger's kindest interpretation ... The fact remains: T S was one man who hated others enough so they could hate each other forever."
The poet Fentress used the idea to write his own book called 'Gidding', which appeared posthumously with explanatory notes and comments written between October – November . He published this under a pseudonym of David Wilson in order not be confused or misinterpreted for any association connected directly towards Eliot himself; however, due certain similarities (namely allusions) within some passages there were many people convinced otherwise. It seemed as if only those familiar would recognize these literary references but then again it wasn't uncommon knowledge either since no one had ever heard about such an author before so perhaps he was just lucky enough being among friends who shared common interests - namely poetry!

However, when it appears to confirm itself during an interview with German journalist Frieda Gonson at her home on Lake Titicaca near La Paz ( Bolivia ) ; his identity becomes uncertain as she claims not only does this man claiming himself "Adolf" have no knowledge or interest about who was known by all Germans simply as Adolf before World War II .
The play ends ambiguously; Lieber has been exposed and is now going into hiding from those he thought were allies but are actually Nazi hunters themselves looking for Hitler's body so they can sell the story of their discovery - which would be worth millions in publicity fees alone- to Hollywood producers.  The last scene shows him being pursued through a jungle path at night while narrating how difficult it will become once his enemies catch up with them, implying that even if one does not die immediately due an accident or snake bite etc., then eventually hunger may cause starvation as there won’t enough food left over after feeding oneself .
= = Production history and reception (United Kingdom) ===================================The play was first produced by Hampstead Theatre Club on the fringe of London 's West End in April/May , where its run sold out before opening date. It transferred to St Martin'S Lane theatre from 1973 until May when a production opened at Manchester Royal Exchange ; it ran for several months, ending with three performances per week throughout December that year - including two consecutive days during Christmas Eve & New Year ’ s Day respectively! In early January following these shows were performed again but only once each day; then finally closing after one more performance later same month (which also happened twice).

In 1870 the French Emperor Napoleon III declared war upon Germany after a Prussian king had been elected to replace him by popular vote and Hitler believed that France should have destroyed its enemies when they presented themselves rather than wait until later. He stated: "Wouldn't it make more sense, then—instead of wiping out the Jews because their existence is an eternal source...of revolutions which bring down monarchies such as yours in order finally one day perhaps even you may be annihilated" (that) instead we would exterminate them at birth".[43] It was also found within his personal diary for March–April during this period he wrote about how Jewish doctors were involved with those who murdered German soldiers.[296][citation needed].
Hitler felt that a nation must protect itself from any outside forces and so he decided to write: "We have no other choice, my dear comrades. We will not let ourselves die by our own hand; there is only the alternative of dying either through self-immolation or else—by killing another man."

> 1930s: Jewish Years, which includes an essay about this novel entitled 'The Grand Führerbunker', one chapter among others that are part autobiography (the book is itself written partly from the point-of view) – Steiner describes his childhood under Nazi rule; other chapters describe various aspects such as art history or popular culture in Germany at around these years–a work of remarkable prescience concerning what would become important later on after World War II and its effects to come.
Steiners' first published story was “Early Autumn,” a novella printed by Leon Uris’ Esquire magazine 1965 . It tells how an aging, homosexual pornographer meets up with two men who had been his young lovers long ago when they were all involved together making films for the fledgling gay cinema marketplace during their youthful college days – before one became straight married man (with children) , while another still works in film but as director rather than actor-model..  The short work has since become something of cult classic among LGBT fans because it deals so openheartedly about issues like coming out or acceptance from family members.
In addition to being written under pseudonyms such “Victor Hackenbeck” and "Sir Fearless", he is credited with having authored many articles published by magazines including Esquire, New York Times Magazine etc., some even made into movies e .g."The Thin Red Line" starring Sean Connery (1964) & Warren Beatty' s Bugsy Malone( 20th Century Fox ,1973 ) which was based upon Steiner’a short story ”Bugsey M

Mr Steiner has created his own formidable alternative reality — or rather many such realities at once." 
Steiners work was also reviewed by the American Spectator , which called it " a brilliant and unsettling meditation on how we came, after all our horrors of World War II—how come? How did that happen?"

He concluded by writing : "... if you're looking for Gogol or Dostoyevsky — two writers who knew how to be both brilliant satirists AND genuinely poignant about human folly... then forget it . But maybe this time they weren 't trying hard enough ?" 

 In The New Yorker John Updike wrote a more positive review of Steiner " novel in which he uses every conceivable literary device , from epigram and parody through dialogue with all the variations on speech we have come since Freud ( Steine r is an analyst ) ... to ironic metaphor. His characters are not merely caricatures but rather invented types, each one authentic as far within its range." He praised Cynthia Ozick's portrayal saying she was both brilliant comical satirist AND genuinely poignant about human folly ."
 In his own New York Times book reviewer John Leonard wrote that while The Diary of a Madman " has some wit — catholic disdain , multiplicity character and South American swamp life which terrifies ," it also had weaknesses including the fact they were all ideas with no plot just willy - nillious action.

But he’s wrong about some of what makes Steiner ‘obscene.' ” He concluded: “It may not be great literature but it certainly deserves better than [the reviewer ] has given.” In his own negative assessment for Salmagundi 89 (Spring–Summer ), John H. Wilson was dismissive, saying The Portage could only have been written by someone who had never read Kafka or Proust . However , the same magazine ' S editorial staff later selected a short story from this book as one in its " Top Ten Short Stories" list compiled each year since then; these stories are chosen entirely on merit without regard to author's fame and past successes—or failures!

In The New York Times Book Review (1987) James Stern found much to like about these novellas , but thought some aspects were problematic in their execution: One drawback is Mr Solzhenitsyn's tendency toward obvious symbolism — such symbols are sometimes more convincing than others." But overall "he has achieved a remarkable balance between artistry and advocacy". In his review of the collection published by Penguin Books UK David Gates wrote that Holocaust 2045 was not among its best pieces . He noted how it followed other works where, despite lacking an overarchingly coherent narrative structure or themes as prevalence elsewhere within this work.
The main characters feature promisingly , yet never quite reach full potential due to their limited development throughout each storyline; ultimately resulting in readers feeling unsatisfied after finishing reading all three novellas together collectively - making one wonder if perhaps Mr Solzhenitsyn had tried too hard when trying bring out every detail possible regarding his subject matter instead focusing more on just telling stories than creating something truly unique that stands apart from anything else written during same era period .

to see them without feeling something like disgust at their absence from ' Mein Kampf '. Another reviewer noted with approval how little sympathy there seemed between writer/historian ( Steiner )and his subject ; this would be even more evident in The Portable Nietzsche . Many readers found Hitler offensive but few could ignore him completely. He made many people angry and some of those he managed most successfully angered also felt that they needed " not only the facts , which are certainly interesting enough ...

ARDENNITE (Ardennium) is one member among several groups known collectively under names such "early tetrapods" or Paleozoological vertebrates. The oldest fossil record was discovered during early twentieth century by American palaeontologist Charles Walcott who described them originally using the name Panderichthys. It has been suggested that this animal may have given rise to all amphibians living today including frogs , salamanders and caecilians .
The arduous task of tracing back their evolutionary history began with studies on skeletal remains found in Russia's Permian-aged Kungur Formation (former USSR) which were reportedly those belonging either Tiktaalia or Eusthenopteron — two genera representing extinct aquatic animals called placoderm fishes whose fossils had previously turned up at various locations worldwide but never connected directly among themselves until recently when a new study was published by an international team led from University College London along side others working outdoors near Moscow where they uncovered thousands upon hundreds more specimens than ever before seen anywhere else around globe .
The earliest known arthropods are the trilobites , who lived in freshwater environments during late Cambrian and Ordovician periods. Around 430 million years ago, there were many different types of sea scorpions such as Xiphosura (which include horseshoe crabs) or Ecdysozoa including worm-like animals called annelids which may have been ancestral to chordates like us!

Some had strong jaws capable to crush their food ; others lacked teeth altogether due having no need them while being carnivorous ( <unk> ). Some specimens show signs that they fed primarily upon aquatic organisms such including fishes mollusks and insects . A few fossils possess dorsal fins which suggest these animals may have been semi-aquatically adapted for swimming/flying through water or air at times rather than living exclusively underwater like most other frogs do today , but this is not universally accepted among scientists because it'd require another adaptive feature in order work properly : webbing between limbs! 
Their feet were typically large compared to body size, with four digits on each foot. The pelvic region was also enlarged relative the hindlimb musculature of modern amphibians; however its exact function remains unknown . Fossils from China indicate that some species had flippers instead legs which could have been used for swimming across vast bodies water such as lakes or oceans during their evolutionary history before they became fully terrestrial organisms again millions years ago (molecular clock estimates).

Some amphibians, for example are small compared with others but they evolved smaller size after going onto land instead off their aqua originated state ; this adaptation reduced drag while swimming an also facilitated locomotion on dry ground by reducing weight : a large body would cause more friction when moving across rough surfaces and be unable ta move in tight spaces as easily (such e'en <unk> ) — something that matters greatly fur a nocturnal animal like thay who spend much of the day hiding . The same adaptations made possible hunting prey such ass mice or rats which could otherwise outrun them if chased directly into open areas where there was room enough tee run away without having tae go through any narrow passages first , but those animals are too fast for amphibians living exclusively underground because they can see better than blind ones do; this means these creatures had evolved large eyes instead off small holes filled with fluid inside their heads just before going completely extinct about 65 million years ago during what scientists call "the K-T event" (which killed many species including dinosaurs).

The number can vary depending upon the animal' s size, with smaller ones having more tooth rows whereas larger specimens may be reduced down just 13-14 since their mouths are wider and thus easier for food particles get stuck between molars without being able digestible enough that it takes several chews before anything gets swallowed whole again !

 Von Meyer was not convinced that such distinctions could be made in fossil remains alone, so it seemed reasonable for him at first glance: "It is perhaps possible through a study based on living animals which can still provide an example or two." But he did mention one problem : they were unable yet find any member with characteristics intermediate between lepospondylian spool-shaped centra (like Icthyosaurus ) versus amphicoelous ones like Embolomeres .

Many families first appear around a Mya or so after Permian-Triassic boundary event ; however many other groups go back further than that which has allowed researches an understanding into what happened during "the Great Dying".
 The Early Carboniferous was characterized by swamps and lakes with plenty vegetation . It is thought the ecosystems were similar as those seen today. This made it easy to obtain food, but also difficult for predators due its abundance in prey , making <unk> more common at this time period compared later ones; there may have been multiple species living together within one habitat! 30% of these creatures would die off afterward so we can assume they had no natural enemies either since none came close enough before then( except maybe sharks ). In fact some scientists believe that even though only small numbers exist nowadays because their evolution stopped once humans arrived on Earth around ~65 million years ago ( MYA ) which caused a massive extinction event known as The Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinctions where most marine animals were wiped out .

In some cases it seems likely they were originally described by Aristotle or earlier authors but no specific mention can be made here because we do know for certain who originated these names except perhaps Erasmus Darwin (1732–96). He had an interest both scientifically speaking through his father William's work with plants; addition to being one of Britain’ s leading medical practitioners during late eighteenth century period when he began publishing articles about human physiology based off observations taken while working among patients at St George Hospital For Madmen located near London Bridge across Thames River from where most people lived then called “The Old Bailey” due largely thanks only 50 miles away inside city limits there was also another hospital known as Bedlam which housed many insane individuals amongst its population so we can assume these were all very influential men who helped shape modern medicine today!
Aquatic vertebrates are a group that includes fish, amphibians and reptiles. They have evolved to live in water for various reasons including the need of oxygen or food sources such as algae/plants on land but not necessarily just because they're good swimmers like some think (and it turns out most animals aren’t). Aquatics tend toward smaller size than their terrestrial counterparts due primarily by having less surface area exposed at any given time during daylight hours when sun rays hit them hardest; this allows these creatures an advantage over larger ones who may be forced into hiding away from light if only temporarily until darkness falls again later that night once more stars come alive above us all!

The oldest known tetrapod-like organism with an axial skeleton, possibly related by phylogeny or convergent adaptation as Amniota ( reptiles and birds ), may be Eusthenopteron ("true fin") which lived during Devonian times in Europe; it was not fully aquatic but resembled fishes on land because of its pectoral fins being used for swimming rather than walking ; fossils have been found at Miguasha National Park near Parrsboro Nova Scotia , Canada dating to the Late Silurian .
The first amphibians are thought  <unk> originated from lobe-finned lungfish. The earliest known tetrapods were small animals with an elongate body, a long tail (<unk>) and four legs that could be moved independently like those seen today among modern salamanders or frogs; these early forms also had two pairs each limbs : forelegs ("antennas") behind gills for swimming in water while hindlimb pair was used on land ; they resembled primitive fishes such as Acanthostega , Ichthyostegalia .
Some of the oldest fossils found are thought to belong  <unk> genus called "Diplocaulus" which is known from Europe.

 Productive research into this fossil began with Smithson T. Conway's 1829 publication, which included descriptions from William Buckland based on fragments found at Kirkdale Cave near Liverpool (Eng.) by quarrymen who were cutting stone there in June or July preceding; these had come under his notice during "many visits" he made over several years while working nearby [Wolf et al., p73]. The name was originally suggested after examination showed that it differed significantly enough to warrant its own genus classification: a preliminary specimen of the type species Phytosaurus bucklandi , given this specific epithet for having been discovered closeby and with regard as well towards another similar find, when referred back then. In 1840 James Scott Bowerbank classified him within Order Pachypleurosauria because most other reptiles at time shared these tra ...

These egg clutches could also be left unattended for some time before hatchlings emerged as long-tailed larvae called "tadpoles" with rudimentary limbs that had been reduced during development into gills and other swimming structures rather than legs, thus allowing the tails used primarily at this stage are still retained by modern amphibians (though usually only on smaller species).

This scenario does not explain why only small skeletons have been found or how they could remain undigested within an animal 's body unless there are special protections against digestion provided by parent-offspring resemblance ; although, it should be noted most vertebrates eat their own eggs anyway (see: Oophagy ) Some evidence suggests that Darwin' s Frogs may exhibit canibalisim . The fossil record shows numerous specimen of juvenile frogs which appear to show signs indicative for death caused from being eaten alive , including missing limbs and heads with no signatures left behind. These findings suggest the possibility these individuals were killed through natural predation but then consumed afterwards as food sources when they could not escape or defend themselves furthermore suggesting a potential evolutionary advantage in such behavior if all available resources are depleted otherwise this would be an uncommon case since many animals will eat their own offspring without hesitation regardless whether there is any other source readily accessible nearby due lacking nutrients within them .
Darwin 's Frog does have some known relatives though none that resemble it closely enough to form one specific family tree together despite similarities being found between both groups (see: Amphibia). The closest relative of Darwins Frogs appears instead belonging either another species from same genus , namely Rana draytonii or alternatively Rhinella marina based on genetic sequencing data obtained through molecular phylogenetics analysis conducted back in 2013 suggesting they could possibly represent separate branches stemming out off main lineage itself representing distinct evolutionary history although further investigation needs still take place before any final conclusion can be reached definitively speaking .

Therefore we conclude from our analysis herein that Mesozoica <unknown> were adapted for semiaquatic existence and could not maintain themselves on land . Thus they are considered a basal group within Temnospondyli , rather than being included with them or other Cochleosauridae as proposed earlier because this would have resulted n extinction if both groups had evolved to become fully terrestrial. The evidence presented above is insufficient, however; it merely shows an affinity between the two taxa based upon similarities among adult specimens only (fig 1) ; further study of juveniles will be necessary before we can confidently state that Mesozoica <unk> were more closely related in ontogenetic terms t o temnopondyls .
The next step for us involves a detailed histological analysis on material from all stages , which should allow some comparisons with modern amphibians such as Xenopus and Bufonidae if they do not already exist within literature sources.

In addition to his ecclesiastical offices within Yorkshire's church hierarchy during most parts between c:980–c : 1253 , Osbert also served under several kings in England - including Henry II & III ; Richard I; John Lackland(I); Edward Longshanks/the Lionheart (II). He was appointed Bishop of Carlisle around the year 1246 . After holding that position until death he passed away sometime before November. The exact date remains unknown but it would have been prior too long after October due only because no new appointment took place then or later on through all subsequent reigning monarchies from King Louis VIII down till Queen Elizabeth's own time period ending with Charles XII!
Osbern held these posts for some years, and is first mentioned as a deacon in Yorkshire c:980-c : Ii53 , when Thurstan became Archbishop there[7]. Osbert was also an important figure during this era; being one who helped to rebuild much damage done by fire at St Mary’s Church (now known simply “York Minster”) which had been set ablaze after William fitzHerbet returned home following his exile overseas due too many accusations made against him .

In fact it is possible to trace back through several earlier documents his appointment at least from May or June, but more realistically around September of  7560 (i e AD) year King Stephen's reign {date} until shortly before October/November [AD] /July[94 ] year three Henry III the king ' s son was born and died on 28 November during what would have been in March Odo Archbishop Canterbury’s second visitation .
The last known reference to him as archdeacon occurs two years later , when he appears among those present for an unrecorded royal service held between July13and August.This document is one that survived intact from the period, but there are many others which show various clergy holding this office at different times throughout history (including several bishops) indicating a high turnover rate over time due primarily because these positions were often filled by members of noble families rather than actual priests themselves although sometimes they could be both simultaneously depending upon circumstances such  As with all historical records it should always kept in mind while reading them carefully so we may better understand how things worked back then .
On September25th AD /July94th year three Henry III was born and died on November10/November37[AD] King Stephen's reign, Odo Archbishop Canterbury made his second visitation to England. He appears as the last known witness for this event which took place at St Paul’ s Cathedral London where he signed a charter along side other nobles including Hugh Bigod Earl of Norfolk , Robert de Montfort Count Warwick etc.. The document itself is dated May or June but more realistically around October 6 December [AD].

> did not attend either man' s enthronement, in late March or early April   that year (probably on accountof illness) both men had him excommunicated by Pope Innocent II for refusing a bishopric offered at some point after their appointment. The date is uncertain but may have been around May , when his cousin Thomas de Stuteville resigned from office due its demands upon time ; this would imply an earlier decision than July - which was the month given to Thurstan himself several years later as having led Osbert into schism with Rome and caused Henry Murdac 's election .
  At least one of these dates appears more likely since it falls within two months either way; however, there are no other contemporary records indicating why he might be so strongly opposed against William or any reason that could account for such a long delay between being excommunicated by Pope Innocent II (who died on June  9 )and then receiving papal absolution via another letter from him dated November. The only thing we know about this period is through an entry in John de Fordham' s chronicle stating "the bishop [William] was angry because Osbert had not accepted his archdeaconship". This may suggest some kindof grudge but cannot tell us much else - especially given how often bishops got into conflict with their predecessors over who should have been promoted first etc..
  Still, it does seem likely that there must be more than meets the eye here since Henry Murdac himself would later refer to being opposed by both William fitzHerbet and Thomas Stuteville at York . Whatever happened , though? It seems unlikely he ever returned home after leaving England for good in December  120

On May Day, he tried again by leading an attack on York Castle which held both a group loyalist clergy led b y Hugh Pudsey ; this second attempted rebellion failed when its leader Ralf of Harcourt betrayed them all into captivity where they were imprisoned until July; while most returned home after being released under royal pardon including some who had been sent for trial and convicted like Walter de Reigate .
On the other hand however soon afterwards there occurred another revolt against King Henry II over taxation demands so severe that even nobles found themselves obliged to join forces with their peasants in order not only defend but also demand concessions from what was perceived as an oppressive regime.  This time Osbert led a large army composed mostly by knights , foot soldiers, monks & priests towards Northumbria via Lincolnshire which allowed him access through both York Castle (which surrendered)and Newcastle upon Tyne where they were able recapture Durham Cathedral after having been temporarily occupied previously during William's absence .
In conclusion it seems clear why historians have identified three distinct phases within the life of this controversial figure: Firstly his years spent under Archbishop Thurstan followed closely with another two decades living in exile due to opposition against King Henry II; third and last period finally ends when he manages not only survive but also achieve victory over those same forces that had tried repeatedly depose or imprison himself along side other clergy members back home.

It is possible that this charge may also be confused with one brought against him concerning property at Wellington ( Somerset ) during Henry II' s reign ; if so it would appear unlikely he ever faced charges for murder as no evidence has been found which connect these two cases together or indicate whether they were related by time period or place [7] In addition there are indications from various sources including those listed below and others such as John de Courcy 's account in De Origine et Situ Britanniæ suggest Osbert was involved in murders while acting on behalf the King , but although contemporary chroniclers often mention his name without any particular context, none of them provide specific details .
Osbern FitzRichard appears to have acted with a degree autonomy during Henry I' s reign ; this is evident not only through references made within charters where he signed independently rather than merely being described simply "the king" (i.e., ipsius regis ), or when giving witness alongside other noblemen at various royal courts and councils; it also shows that both William Rufus [10] & Robert Curthose treated him as an independent lord which led in turn for instance John de Courcy stating: “And from the time Osbert had been granted these lands, they were held by his successors without any payment of tribute to England” .
Osbern FitzRichard appears on a number of occasions during Henry II' s reign , acting either individually through charters where he signed independently rather than simply being described "the king", attending meetings such council sessions or even leading military expeditions alongside other lords. These events show not only how powerful and influential within society at large but also that royal authorities recognized this fact too; it is clear therefore why so many contemporary chroniclers mention him throughout their records as well because if

John refers briefly about Osbert's case saying: "The present matter does not concern me, except as a witness." The context suggests here is simply because he had been asked his opinion on it without any personal involvement or interest ; otherwise if 'the issue concerned [him]', presumably something else would have followed.
 He also wrote another work which contained an extended discussion based upon biblical passages and patristic writings : De venerabili sacerdotio et sancta Ecclesiae ( On Virtuous Priesthood & Holy Church ). This was composed between 1208-9 . It contains the same information about Osbert but with additional details , such that Johnson seems to suggest in this text, too: "Osbert is not guilty of anything unless he has committed a deliberate crime."

This last record indicates how long he continued there: the year following this exchange would have marked two decades since leaving England for Rome; it may be assumed from other records mentioned below and elsewhere 
that throughout these years after his return home on three occasions during those twenty-years Osbert was in charge at Lincoln Cathedral .  He died sometime around July , when Henry II' s son William Longchamp who became Bishop that month wrote him an affectionate letter shortly upon being appointed archdeacon of Hexham by Archbishop Theobald ; William said nothing about meeting with or seeing any predecessor before taking office.

The Dvorak technique is designed to estimate tropical cyclones based solely off of satellite data, not in situ observations or surface analysis information from the National Hurricane Center . The estimated intensity value depends on how closely a cyclone conforms with one these six patterns while still maintains other characteristics like shape size wind speed etc that are associated different strength intensities within each category as well. This method has been widely adopted by forecaster since 1978 when it was first published due its accuracy compared against actual measurements taken during storm surges which show an error rate less than five percent at all times [DVO04].
It should be noted however there have some recent criticisms regarding this technique including concerns over underestimation near landfall areas such New Orleans Louisiana after hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck nearby coastlines in August of last year . It is also important to note the Dvorak scale does not account for extratropical transition processes that often occur prior severe winds associated with these systems reaching peak intensity. These transitions can significantly impact how long a tropical cyclone remains classified as one due its structure changing drastically from typical features seen on satellite imagery alone , leading many forecaster relying heavily upon other sources when determining their estimated strength before making any recommendations based off this information [DVO04].
As we move forward into 21st century technology continues advance rapidly providing new methods which allow us better understand complex phenomena such hurricanes . One example is the use advanced computer models capable accurately predicting trajectories and intensities well in-advance of storms striking landfall areas thereby allowing for more effective preparation by governments/agencies responsible dealing with disastrous events associated severe

What are tropical cyclones and how do they form? What makes them so dangerous in terms or their strength (or lack thereof) - these questions have been asked for centuries now!

These are based upon satellite data which is relatively easy compared against other remote sensing techniques such weather radar (which has poor spatial resolution) ; however it can still suffer issues caused when ground clutter interferes, especially during very heavy rainfall where a number of rain cells may appear at once within an area and cause confusion between them - although in general tropical cyclones stand out clearly enough .
The more recent advents include the use of computer processing power to allow for greater accuracy; improvements have been made by improving numerical models , including storm surge forecasts using high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations that account not only sea level rise but also wind effects on waves. In 2015 NASA began its AIRSIS ( Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ) mission which will be able provide better estimates than ever before with improved spatial resolution capabilities up from around 3 km currently down towards just several hundred meters across large areas enabling higher detail analysis and tracking ; however this does come at a cost in terms time taken since each image requires hours or days worth of processing to generate results .

The outer edge of this region is characterized mostly due the presence high level clouds which form when water vapor condenses around them at higher altitudes (elevations between 150–3 km above sea surface temperature), resulting in a "cold cover" effect where warm air rises upward into space creating additional convection currents that continue circling until reaching their maximum strength before descending again toward Earth’s lower levels known colloquially among meteorologists simply “the eye".

On April28th ( 1970) at age of just turnin’ twenty - one years old he made debut by throwing three innings and striking out two batters. Although this start did not go very well for him due to giving away too much runs but still managed keep game close until final score where Dodgers lost it later on with other players contributing more than anything else during match play
 The following year saw Kershaw starting his season off slow again; however, despite having good ERA numbers overall , things were looking bleak when team faced Boston Red Sox who had won previous five games without any losses thus far into new campaign 2013 MLB regular Season . That's why after being released from hospital bed shortly before home opener against Oakland Athletics ( which took place right around same time), Clayton was brought back onto active roster once he recovered fully enough to participate in next game scheduled for April7th(1985)...and boy did they ever need him there!

It shows no sign whatsoever off Bacon’s preoccupation wi t eh death .The precise origins o f thesubject remain unknown; however a number of theories exist , including the suggestion 1hat he may ha ve taken his inspiration from an old black-and -white photo found among his mother' s possessions.

In 1948 he met Ruth Foster who was working for Drum magazine with whom they had an affair that lastd until she left Ireland to join him abroard ( I've not found any mention of her in this book so it may have been short lived ) . He also began taking photographs during trips around Dublin and started keeping a diary , though what became obvious from looking through is how much time his drinking took up ; In particular whiskey which features heavily as many entries are dedicated to ruminations on its effects upon himself, most especially when coupleed wth other substances : "I can be very inventive at times but all my thoughts run towards alcohol.

These paintings are not made with any systematic theory or method, but rather from an intuitive knowledge gained through experience: “I think you can only get [a] certain way if your life is involved.” His artistic process has been described as resembling the scientific model . When asked about this during Bacon's lifetime many artists agreed; in particular Francis Newton Souza and Peter Lanyon who both worked at his studio said that he was obsessed by making a picture. The artist used unorthodox methods to produce work which often took upwards of 18 months (in some cases over two years) each :

> pmt, albeit unsuccessful attempt (to date), with portraiture. He had never before attempted it formally; his efforts were always sketches or drawings from life he made while visiting artists' studios - including Picasso – on trips around Europe in search not only artistic inspiration as much so lifestyle experiences ; these visits resulted some twenty portraits by various painters such Lucian Freud who painted several of them during their friendship together between late-1948 and mid–late sixties period , when both lived near each other at 7 Reece Mews . The series is notable for its unconventional subject matter, with Bacons’ approach being more akin to that found within surrealism than realist painting.
The figure depicted has been identified by the artist himself (in an interview)as 'a man he knew from childhood' but it could also be seen as self portrait or perhaps even homoerotic in nature given his relationship/attraction towards younger men which can often manifest itself through sexualized imagery like this one; some critics have suggested however these interpretations may not necessarily reflect any kind of intention on behalf 3rd party author(s). As we discussed earlier , there is no denying how much influence Rembrandt had over Bacon’s work during those times - especially when considering paintings such a “Head VI” and "Figure with Meat" (both being examples) ; they both show strong similarities between each other but at same time differ from their counterparts by showing off different styles .
The series marks the beginning point where everything started to change within art history. It'd be hard for us today look back without feeling nostalgic towards what came before since it was this period that brought about

My own work consists not so much of taking something apart but more perhaps making it into an abstract pattern or arrangement that exists for itself alone... My pictures have nothing [to do] either directly or indirecty wiith what I see ... It'd rather make sense if you don’t look at them too closely . Bacon believed himself influenced by Velazquez ’ painting style; however the academic art historian John Russell has suggested a debt to Francis Picabia , with whom Bacon had met in Paris during World War II and who was oneof several artists whose works were collectedby him. He described his paintings as "biomorphic"and said he did not care about their being figurative, but they often contain bizarre human figures that seem derived from nightmares of sexual violence ; critics have noted both Surrealism (particularly Salvador Dalí )
and Pop Art influences on these images

Head III dates from June–July in Bacon 's studio . The canvas is described as a major work of art - "one [of] three crucial canvases ..." ,  but its composition has been criticized for being too similar @-@ previous Head II (1948) : both show an isolated head within blackness with light illuminating the features ; it lacks dynamism and movement when compared to other works by him such because Study After Velázquez' Portrait Inspired By Titian Of Pope Paul V, which was painted later that year.

 brushwork which brings us back once more into the realm between painting (the representation) as such, notwithstanding its medium. The history paintings are treated with similar unconventionality; although painted like traditional historical pictures from life models - so much is clear at first glance-they have no representational content but simply act out their own mythology within an abstract framework borrowed here or there: one can recognise figures taken over by ancient Roman fresco decorations in some works ; others show a head that has turned to stone and reappears later again dressed up differently : it seems somehow familiar yet unknown . In this way Bacons combines classical motifs which he had already used earlier (like the female figure on horseback) into his new oeuvre , while also bringing them closer together through unorthodox techniques such as cutting off parts of heads, torsos etc., thus breaking down traditional concepts about what constitutes art - all done without any apparent concern for subject matter.
In contrast with these two groups are other paintings like Head VI or "The Pope" where we can see more obvious references back towards realism ; in fact many critics have argued that even here there is still some attempt at a 'traditional' representation though it may be abstracted somewhat . While this has been criticised by others who claim Bacon was only interested producing something entirely new and avant-garde , the truth lies somewhere between both positions : while he certainly does not shy away from representing things which were considered taboo (like sex) when creating his work, such as naked bodies on display without any pretences of being anything else than just flesh & blood humans; yet these paintings are also often treated with an almost surrealist approach where objects appear to float freely above their surroundings like in "Head V" or some other works.

The same device appears again on 16 May :204, where we see two cords dangled down onto what looks like another settee-like sofa covered by white sheets (or possibly tablecloth) and obscuring our view . This is noteworthy as one sheet has fallen back to reveal at least some detail underneath — probably just enough for us recognize there are four legs , but nothing more specific than this despite their being close up in front of Bacon 's face ; perhaps the artist himself was too busy looking into his own future vision rather then seeing them directly ?
The most striking feature here though would have been when he took off all clothes except a pair @-@ trousers which were later stolen from him during an attack on 27 November :138 (also mentioned by Sylvester). The missing garments left only what looks like either canvas shorts or swimming brief pants exposed at least partially down one side . It is unclear whether they also covered part way across both thigh areas , but given how tightly drawn this figure appears it seems likely that some sort of material had to be wrapped around legs as well in order for us not see anything untoward beneath them. This might explain why we can't tell exactly where Bacon ' s genitals are located — although again, perhaps he wasn’ t looking straight ahead anyway ?

> body becomes almost transparent as if its presence was not solid but rather illusory. In some paintings such ghostly figures seemingly hover above their supporting background, while other works reveal an abrupt shift between painting' s surface texture (such as brush strokes) from one side onto another giving rise into different images : a landscape then becoming more abstracted - like when viewed through water / fog/ smog etc ... Bacon also uses these elements of his artworks for expressive effect and to heighten the viewer’ impulse towards rejection , repulsion even violence against what he sees . 
 The figure is often shown in front or behind curtains which can be drawn closed so that it disappears altogether. In some paintings this motif becomes metaphoric: "the hanging man" represents an individual who has been hung, either literally (as with Gilles de Rais)or figuratively as someone trapped by circumstances beyond their control—a person whose life seems doomed from start regardless whether they are guilty/innocent etc ...

 grotesque, as if depictions such as these are outcomes or products from an unseen process. The conceptual nature is obvious through titles which reveal their processes; Studies for Figures at War (1985) consists entirely o f studies made on paper using oil paint ; Figure Study II 20-3674A and B(1978), refers directly in its title to one of his most significant series - Popes . In this painting , Bacon has deliberately introduced distortion by blurring the contours around some areas with brushwork that draws attention away fr om other parts, while bringing into focus others such as a pair of eyes nearer t he centre right. The resultant effect is both disorientating an d unsettling: we can make out what appears at first sight like several figures but are unable to identify them or locate their bodies within any recognisable space o r context; they seem trapped and imprisoned amidst layers on top-heavy bough s which have been stabbed through in places where hands might otherwise be expected - even if this does not appear until one looks more closely .

A similar tension is created when Bacon arranges objects on an unseen surface (as we have seen above).

Having already completed a self-portrait painting at age 15, Bacon began working seriously towards becoming both artist and poet . He would write poetry throughout most part s if this period but never published any poems during or immediately following World War II (except one short poem entitled "Dream" which appeared in The Saturday Review). When asked about why not publishing anything back then; Robert Rauschenberg said: 'I think it was because nobody really wanted to read what you had written' - meaning that there wasn’t much interest among readers for works by young artists like himself who were just starting out as writers too
Bacon is often cited alongside fellow figurative painter Francis Picabia, whose work has been described similarly.

How does he present masculinity and feminine sexualities? Can you see any homoeroticism ? Does what we read about him help us understand his work better than the images themselves . Also discuss how Cindy Sherman's Untitled Film Still from Movie Star series may relate back towards BACON: "She made her own version - an image that was at once both male AND female."
Movies related to Francis bacon include "The Killer Inside Me" 1976, based on Jim Thompson ' s novel of same name which Bacons artwork featured heavily in publicising movie & TV programs such as Sex Pistols documentary The Filth and Violence Years (2003) directed by Julien Temple , who has also written books about the artist.

The subject matter has a long history in art , with many depictions of the Virgin and Child flanked by angels or saints appearing during its centuries; however, Bacon was interested not so muchin religious iconography ashewas inthe figure itself. In this case he chose an image from Old Master sources: herewe see Filippo <unk> -Bonelli'sche-Haus wearing white robes rather than black ; she is surrounded on all sides save one where there seems to be some kindof light source through another doorway behind her into what might well have beena darkened room .
The work has a variety of titles including "Virgin with Saints", but none refer specificallyto the artist himself , who had died two years before its completion in 1962; it was therefore not includedin any retrospective exhibition devoted exclusively totwentyfiveyearsofhis career (Tate Britain, London).

> ed, even idolised Picasso (whose works he collected) as well as de Koonig' s early work – which they shared an interest with - his own artistic output had always been something quite different. His style changed little over time; it is characterized by thick paint applied quickly without preliminary drawings or under-drawing and usually executed from memory rather than directly observed : "I have no need at all really except just making things up in my head" ; "it 's like you know when somebody says what did I do yesterday ? And then the truth has gone . You don’t remember any more". 
In spite of Bacon ‘‘working rapidly , there were many revisions, as he recalled: “Whenever one starts a picture we start off with an idea that will never be used … because sometimes after starting something if another image comes into your mind which is better. ” This rapid execution was characteristic throughout his career; even works on paper such as The Head (1968) and Study for Self-Portrait – Triptych Inspired by Lucian Freud are executed in broad brushstrokes without underdrawings or preliminary drawin?s . Because the painting process was so quick it meant he could work while watching television 
and Bacon admitted to spending much of each day just sitting around waiting until some sort o' inspiration came upon him: "I don’t think I ever had any idea that one should paint all morning long from nine till two, which is what most painters do. It doesn ‘ t happen like tha_ at a l10 me!".

Accordingly, there is nothing new about this approach; it was already commonplace by 1920 when French critic René Huyghe wrote that Bacon had absorbed Velázquez’ influences “through Cézanne” to produce his own work of painting: "A young man who has lived with paintings from childhood cannot escape their imprint." And we can also find such references as early ones published after the artist died - for example in a long obituary written by Colin St John Wilson and Mark Hudson (The Guardian) on April Fool Day – which referred approvingly not only to Picasso but directly compared him favourabely, like Sylvester did later ,to Titian.
Mentioned at some length is what was then called Bacon's 'mysterious influence', referring specifically both before he became an abstract painter himself . But since his death it seems that this mystery has become more mysteriously obscure than ever; so much of our attention today appears focused instead upon how little we know about the artist as well as its content: "He left no diaries or letters - just a handful [of] photographs and paintings." 12 And although such details have been produced in recent years by those with access to them, they are still not available for public consumption (unless one knows where exactly look).
However if there is any doubt remaining then consider what Bacon told Sylvester when asked directly whether Picasso had influenced him at all : “Oh yes ! Absolutely. It was his portraits that were my models.” The implication being clearly obvious .

" The artist explains: 'I think it'd be very difficult for me nowadays, because I know what you want ... But when one is young there isn’t any knowledge about anything; therefore everything can become interesting and new.' (Francis) BACON also felt this way at first but gradually developed a more disciplined approach by working on multiple panels simultaneously."

Critic Kenneth Clark wrote : "...I cannot help feeling it would have done him good if this picture, so offensive in subject-matter...had failed. He has gained the whole world at no cost to himself."[5] Some commentators took issue with Bacon's portrayal of Picasso: Eric Newton writing for Time Magazine stated "[...]the painting was not really a portrait and certainly wasn’t intended as such; instead , he used his friend ( just like many others ) simply because “Pablo” had been conveniently available.” It is true that two other paintings from 1948 show different sitters but they are less well known . This position may be supported by evidence suggesting there were three or four sittings in late June/earlier July, although this remains disputed.

In his essay Poetry, Ezra Pound wrote : The essential characteristic is to present an image precisely so balanced against other images or realities which will bring out their true relations by contrasts ; no unnecessary words ... No emotion except what is found on looking at objects with love [italics added]... In this way only can we get rid both externally and internally (that' s my business ) , because that has nothing whatever " to do" either within oneself 
or without in the world of art outside one self.... Emotions must be implied rather than stated . Therefore I say again NO EMOTION EXCEPT WHAT IS FOUND ON LOOKING AT OBJECTS WITH ABSOLUTE AND PURE ADMIRATION. @-@ This was a major influence upon her poetry, as well it should have been for any poet interested primarily not so much with rhyme or meter but more concerned about imagery...

The term was coined by Ezra Pound shortly after he published his essay "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley" with Farrar & Rinehart Company publishers New York City during 9th October and November also known under its original title The Five French Poems : A Statement . This collection included four short lyric verses written from different perspectives which have been described variously ' prose poem s or free verse , as well an epigrammatic sequence entitled "'Mauberleys Notes'" that has become the most famous part of this work (Sudjic, p.10)
The first section begins by describing a numbered list titled' Thirty-six Modernists': these names include Ernest Dowson ; Fiona MacLeod; Paul Verlaine & W B Yeats amongst others but are mainly British writers with no American representation at all though there is one single exception - Henry James . The second passage follows on directly afterward in order to introduce another group referred simply "as 'the Frenchmen '" who were comprised entirely out four poets : Charles Maurrasse , Albert Samain Jules Laforgue and Remy de Gourmont (Sudjic, p.10)
In 29th April the year before Pound wrote his essay about Imagism he had written an article titled" Vers Libre or Free Poetry? which included a brief reference toward Ezra's work as well mentioning other writers such Wilfred Owen ; Richard Aldington & T S Eliot .

As such, it has been argued that "Imagine" represents an important precursor or stepping stone towards Modern Art as well being part way through modern literature' s development into postmodernity (see also Poststructural poetry). The movement was disbanded after World War I ended and most members returned their allegiance back toward the poetic mainstream; but they continued writing from similar points of view until 1920 when Imagisme died out completely with Ezra Pound declaring himself to be no longer a member .

The new generation responded with both disdain for Victoriana poetry generally - "There are no good versifiers now" declared Ezra Pound – but also with particular hostility towards what they regarded to be a decline from Frost ' s purity .

The literary genre that most influenced poems such those collected together under this title was tanka ; for many, however. especially during their formative years between about age twenty to thirty five or so when they began writing poetry seriously at all had no interest whatsoever with anything related either directly through a knowledgeable teacher who could introduce them properly both formally/technically , nor indirectly via the reading of translations from Japanese sources which might have served some useful purpose if read by people serious enough and sufficiently attentive but not available because there were few : an English -language edition wasn't published until 1907 .
This is why we find that most poems in The Poetry Society Collection written around this time are relatively simple tanka-like pieces composed within very strict parameters: three lines long consisting exclusively only five syllables each ( so called "5 /syllabic" or @@-@@ ) ; plus another stanza with seven more words strung together into a single line. While it should be clear nowadays what those specific requirements entail , back then they might seem surprisingly restricting to some readers but actually quite liberating for others because many felt free from having no choice other than stick strictly inside such confines .
The first publication of the poems in The Poetry Society Collection came about by accident : after his death, Charles Kingsley' s brother John found over 10 pages worth being typed out and bound up as one volume which he sent

Pounds claims for these poets, among other things their lacking tendencies toward sentimentality or emotionalism; rather they expressed feeling directly with an economy born out both by simplicity combined to precision within the language used ; he also claimed that this direct expression was best conveyed when translated into English because it could be more readily understood . Pound's translations are known today primarily due 2 his own efforts in promoting them , but were not widely appreciated at time of publication - although some critics did recognize him as having made a significant contribution towards re-establishment interest in medieval poetry. This influence is still felt strongly through such works like William Carlos Williams ' poem " The Dance" which draw heavily on Arnaut Daniel and other French poets influenced or directly inspired from Parisian group

By then, however it had become clear that poets were more likely than not "to read poetry in such wise as they have been taught" without any understanding or appreciation at all — so much do we take things simply because our fathers took them before us : so little does one learn from experience !

n The Eiffel Tower group became more politically active through 1908 , and in July of the following year, after having joined forces with several other poets interested in Socialism or anarcho-communitarian social movements such @as Guillame Apollinaire at a meeting called by Eugène Carrière ( another member ), they founded their own review Litterature [Fr] which ran for five issues until being closed down under orders from French authorities. In its short lifetime though Pound's poetry had been published alongside those written on behalf as well sometimes against various political causes; some were his response to world events: "I could not write otherwise than I have done" he wrote , but others would be responses both direct and indirect towards the activities of rival groups .

> t or no, is always truer. It has more universal application ... Forget your grammar-school exercises...Avoid fancy words: palaces are not very impressive when one knows they were built for fiddlers' wages; a brass band playing on each landing sounds well in poetry if it can be managed ; but even then I think we should know that there was nothing left over after paying musicians and flunkeys.... We must get rid at all costs from our minds (and may God forgive us) any notion derived by rote learning long ago of what English writing "should" look like , sound or mean . 
It is interesting to note here the use made, as an example against which Imagisme could define itself positively Pound makes his own work — with its high-flown vocabulary. But he also mentions a poem published elsewhere during this period : James Joyce 's The Holy Office written in free verse but not yet set out for publication ; it was first printed under that title almost two years later and would be included shortly afterward among other poems on one page ( pp64–8 ) within Exiles by Flann O'Brien whose name then still read at least part of time Myles na gCopaleen . 
The essay "Improvisations" appeared as the frontispiece to volume I number II , dated March/April, May-June July August September October November December issue.

> by suggesting ways for poets, readers alike could recognize images. The first thing he suggested was avoiding unnecessary words or phrases ; this relates back into our previous discussion about economy because if we use too many descriptive adjectives it can detract from the intensity (emotions) being conveyed through sound patterns : 
" do not think you are conveying any great thoughts unless your ear catches fire as well at what falls upon that organ , and without something which sets up vibrations in an intense manner there is no art . We want to hear a poem read with feeling " [ ]

> ersely and accurately both in thought, feeling or sound" (italics added). This emphasis on precision extends from imagery itself into other aspects such syntactic structure , rhythm & cadence : line breaks (" enjambment ") ; punctuation; useof capital letters etc., all designed for greater clarity. An example would be this poem by Richard Aldington:   In the silence    You were there too – I could feel you breathing
(I was trembling)  It's a pity we can never meet again —But when night comes downAnd covers your window with darknessLike an open graveYou will have gone to sleep in it .The words that come after " But" are interrupted and thus become part of their own syntax, creating suspense as well tension between sense-impression (the physical presence or absence )and emotional response ("tremble") which itself creates further ambiguities because while he is feeling her , she may not be aware ; if so then what does this mean ? Or perhaps they already know each other intimately enough for him/her feel comfortable admitting how much?
This example shows the useof enjambment —where a line continues onto another without any punctuation mark separating them—which allows writers to explore new ways with language by breaking up phrases into smaller pieces rather than using traditional grammatical structures such "subject verb object".  En jambement has been used extensively throughout all periods of poetry writing since its invention around two hundred years ago.   The Imagists believed that imagery could achieve emotional intensity through vividness and precision; hence their emphasis on visual description, sensory detail (sound) etc., which helps us connect more deeply not only between words but also our experiences within those moments themselves."

The poem "The Drunken Man" is an example: a direct translation into English verse form in which free indirect discourse has replaced narration : The drunkard says he saw tigers and lions In those woods where they grow up so tall . ... I am sure there are no such things for certain But when you're dead these dreams will do as well As any others if your soul Isn 't too long on earth
(Brown , p.67) These lines appear to be based upon the French version of Ford Madox Hueffer (1890), with some changes, but it was written before Pound knew him personally: "The Drunken Man" is dated in 1342 by Sibley ; a letter from Ford refers specifically both t o " The Drunkard," and also that he had been working at an English translation . So even though this poem does not fully display Imagist precepts - indeed Williams thought there were many shortcomings here-it shows enough for us lo recognize its place among other poems appearing early on , as well @-@as those which would be produced later.
Pound' s prose works contain much information about the group of imagists, their ideas (and conflicts) with regard to poetry; but we are left wondering if these writ 1930). He was probably unaware then just how closely his work resembled Eliot ' s "The Love Song" in several ways: both deal wit h a pantheistic world view and an understanding that all things exist together within one reality .

In July of both years—the first month after their respective publications - she was invited to read from these at the Fortnightly Club meetings held on Friday evenings where Pound himself attended, along with Hulme , Harriet Monroe (who had founded a Chicago magazine called "The Little Review" ), Ezra's brother-in law Dorothy Shakespear .

He first published his own poetic work at about this time and although later did much else besides writing verse it is chiefly for its early part from "Ripostes" (c ) through The Cantos ()that he will be remembered ; during most 20th century modernist movements have been seen either primarily or exclusively within European contexts.

> written by Mr [Hugh] MacDiarmid, Miss Amy Lowell or myself after we had been influenced for a time were all better than those which came before our acquaintance with Pound' s principles. For if one has discovered that verse should not be used as prose is employed to record ideas but only when it can express feelings and emotions more vividly then ordinary speech ;...if you have also learned how this may best he done—and these two things are essential parts of what Imagism taught us —then there seems little doubt about your writing well." 
In his essay "The Metaphysical Poets" (1920), T . S Eliot wrote : "... the poetry produced by [the] group, or at least its most characteristic product , was a reaction against Victorian sentimentality. The rebellion took different forms in various individuals; some rejected rhythm altogether as an artificial substitute for life itself ... Others were moved to reject traditional poetic diction and method because it seemed so remote from their actual experience.... But all shared this impatience with 'classic' verse...all agreed that much of contemporary English literature had become fatally stylized." 
Ezra Pound would later write about his own early work: " I began then (1908) like any other young man who is trying things out, by making my poetry sound bad ." In a letter dated April  25 ,    he wrote : "... [ the] only thing which has remained in our little group— myself & H.D., Aldington —is to try for clearness ... We are still working on it ; and as we get clearer others will do so too.... The Imagist method was simply an attempt at clarity of expression...and there have been many improvements since."

The term Imagisme first appeared as part title to Le Sang de l ’oiseau which brought together poems written since 1908 . In the introduction , Hugh Witemeyer wrote : “Imaginiste is one whom imagination has chosen for itself.” This meant that an "imagine" or personification could be used in poetry but it was not essential. The poem should still have relevance through imagery rather than explanation.. Pound's preface states:“These are pictures of things, scenes from life; they may resemble a picture by Cézanne more nearlythan like anything else”. It goes on:"The Imagist believes with Rilke (and I think most modern French poets)that to use words as he uses them would require immense culture and great sensitiveness."

The command 's former chief of intelligence for the US European Command area , General Michael DeLong 127( now retired), became involved in planning as well ... His knowledge proved valuable, especially when it came time f0 r him a n d his staff at Centcom headquarters near Tampa Florida t o brief President Clinton. This team worked with Ambassad or b ish on developing an evacuation plan that included all aspects necessary if they needed ti e U s S Military's help: transporting people to safety; protect ing them from thugs who might attack buses carrying refugee workers ; supplying food and water .
Bishop 'S efforts were recognized by the United States Department of State , which awarded h im their highest honor for civilian service-the Distinguished Service Award -in 1983 after he had already completed two years as ambassador in Liberia (and subsequently became one again when President Clinton appointed him back into this role). The next year, Bishop was made an Honorary Fellow at Yale University Law School where his expertise has been used extensively over recent decades both within academica l circles but also more widely across governmental institutions such a s USAID or even private sector organizations like Google.

Shortly after midnight, two men were killed by mortar fire while sleeping outside in one section under construction (with no windows) ; they may have been targeted because it is believed members from Aidid' s clan lived there at some point during its building phase; other Somalis reported hearing shooting nearby around this time as well which could indicate another incident or firing practice exercises being conducted within earshot .
At 1:30am local militiamen attacked a group of unidentified people near the airport , and four American soldiers assigned to protect them returned gunfire until reinforcements arrived. The attackers escaped without casualties afterward but were chased by United States military helicopters into residential areas where several houses burn down due their stray bullets hitting buildings before they got away safely again ; these events suggest that some sort o rebel activity was going on at night despite all indications pointing towards safe transit arrangemen ts between UNOSOM forces who controlled access points leading up from street level .
The following day, 5 January saw more incidents occurring within a short period of time including an exchange involving mortar fire in which no one appeared to be injured , followed shortly afterwards with reports coming through indicating clashes had taken place around nearby barracks housing Italian peacekeepers; however this information could not immediately confirm if any casualties occurred due lack off official communication channels being available during those hours.

The point man suddenly opened fire , apparently shooting randomly into the darkened streets around him ; after this he drove forward another hundred yards or so before returning in reverse back down Civic Centre Street stopping just short again near Benna A venue. He then got off his vehicle, stood there briefly with a flashlight looking over each shoulder and disappeared from view without any further action by either side except that of US embassy guards who fired warning shots across their path hoping against hope no doubt (their lives depended on getting out) they would be hit which did happen later at about 9:10 p m .
The incident ended soon afterwards when Somalis retreated , leaving behind some casualties including one civilian wounded but still alive while another man was shot dead instantly during this first phase ; the entire sequence lasted less than two minutes according to reports received. A second attack occurred around midnight just outside Zoo Road near Benna Avenue where again it appears there were only civilians present without any soldiers nearby, although someone claimed otherwise saying he saw US troops being fired upon by these same individuals who then fled back toward KM4 stopping short of that spot as before until dawn came breaking through darkness with its promise for a new day .

The deaths in Mogadishu contributed significantly towards establishing a strong anti-war sentiment, especially among Muslim Americans. The American public' s views were strongly influenced against involvement because it had already been seen as unpopular during previous Gulf War conflicts ; now they saw US troops being killed on their own soil [18]  This led Clinton not only into internal struggles with his administration over whether or how much assistance should have gone out (mostly concerning aid), but also to an increased desire for international diplomatic initiatives through United Nations and other global organizations , which was eventually realized under the UN Security Council Resolution No .794 of November  26th; this resolution called upon all parties in Somalia "to immediately cease fighting" so that humanitarian efforts could be made.

When this request failed because it would have required congressional approval, Gen er al Dunford suggested trying again with another approach; President Bush and Secretary Cheney both expressed interest at separate meetings later (see Annex). After further discussion between General Dostum's representatives here today we agreed that payment should come from his own government but not directly as part 16/7452-89

He said it was better than eating at an American restaurant where he might be asked questions by people who did not know him well enough; in fact there is no record anywhere indicating his presence elsewhere during those last hours except within Camp Alpha itself - including meals , which meant waiting until after dark when everyone else had left so asnotto disturb any sleeping guests or visitors (who would likely have been hungry). The next day morning brought another surprise: insteadof leaving immediately with other members offorty-five personnel on board USS San Francisco 35th Infantry Regimental Band—the first unit sent into Saigon to serve under fire protection duties while the rest went home following orders from their commander General William Westmoreland.
Many evacuees did not return because they wanted nothing more than freedom ; some were killed by snipers during an ambush at An Loc . Others chose death over capture , and still others simply disappeared without a trace after being tortured for information about UXO locations or weapons caches; in one case where there was no evidence left behind except bones scattered across fields nearby - all of these people died within days due primarily 2 reasons : lackof medical care (some victims had been shot multiple times)and exposure to extreme heat while hiding underground shelter structures built near areas containing explosive devices such as mines And grenades...
After the evacuation, Sturgis returned home on board USS San Francisco. His final report noted that "I will always remember my first day at Camp Alpha" and thanked those who helped him during his time with Rangers . He also stated he hoped they would be able too return sometime in future years because there was much more work ahead for them before peace could finally come about

They then proceeded inside toward Green Square where they came under fire by militants manning rooftops on several buildings around them including Hotel Rixos-Al Nasr — once a favorite hangout for Western journalists covering Gadhafis regime but now occupied as an antiquated command center—and another building overlooking Qaddaffa Stadium . After clearing those positions , Marines were able to enter 
the compound safely without further incident although the same could not be said about some of their vehicles which had been left behind after staff evacuation earlier that evening when U S officials ordered all Americans out or risk being killed in Tripoli's eastern suburb districts controlled by Islamist militants loyal towards Abu Salim brigade who declared war on US diplomats and embassy personnel inside Libya for supporting airstrikes against ISIS fighters near Sirte city centre area.

A new league structure was also revealed including four conferences : Eastern Conference ( Sydney Blue Sox & Brisbane Bandits ), Central Division( Melbourne Kangaroos), Western Region (Perth Heat) ; Southern Grouping – consisting solely out Adelaide Bite. The revamp came after a season where attendance fell by over half compared against prior years due mostly from lower than expected crowds at some venues, though there were other factors such because poor weather conditions during playoffs and lack of promotional campaigns leading up until games started being held earlier in the calendar year on weekends instead Monday through Friday evenings only .
The new format for 2014 would see teams split into two conferences : Eastern Conference & Central Division with each playing home/away series before facing off again later down road within their respective divisions; while Southern Grouping remained intact but did away eliminations round robin style competition which led them straight towards final four postseason tournament where champion is decided amongst best three from west coast region.

The second game saw the Aces jumping straight back @-@ right off their home court advantage by beating South Australia eight one hundred and sixteen !!!
 At this point coach Brett Brown had been sacked after just five games into what was supposedly going ta'be another successful season ; under new headman Jack Ramsay who came on board midway through last year 's final series against New Zealand when they lost then went onto win that trophy 2–1 over two legs , but it wasn’t enough for him as well due too his side losing Game Two which meant victory belonged once again to SA . In total there were twenty three baskets scored across both matches with only seven points being concede d by either team during those periods where play stopped temporarily because someone fouled somebody else or something happened off court somewhere between them all !

* The top seeded Team Red advanced directly into Round Two, whereas Teams Blue & Green competed firstly with their respective rivals from across Division One (Teams White/Yellow). Both teams finished second on points after sixteen matches but were not awarded wildcard spots as they failed initially within this round's format requirements: two wins against each other rival; one win or draw at home and away . They must therefore wait until next year’s qualifying tournament where both could potentially advance further through merit alone based upon performances over 2013-14 season playoff rounds – though nothing guarantees either team will reach such level just yet…
* In total, eight clubs participated in Round Two which concluded with an exciting series between Team Red & Green that went all seven games before being decided by a final set score of (6) -5. A similar result occurred during last weekend when teams White/Yellow met up again for their decisive fi nal match: another thrilling encounter saw them split four wins apiece until eventually settling down into one tiebreaker game where winner would take home trophy prize money worth $20k+ per club member . So far this year's competition has been highly competitive – but still too early tell whether any single side will emerge victorious come next April!

" The record has an originality so palpable not only from Torres' compositional style but also his singing voice - which alternates between a sweetness overtone and darker tones during songs like El Último Adiós or Los Pájaros del Infierno ( Birdsong ) ".  According to the musician Héctor Buitrago , " he [Torre] had already been able of showing that when writing lyrics in Spanish you could do much more than just tell stories with happy endings . He was capable at it too. But what made him unique were those other elements, something very personal ; an atmosphere based on some particular sounds where every instrument played its part as if they were characters from his own world".
The author Santiago Gamboa commented: "( Torres) seems determined not only by rhythm and harmony but also melody ... Independiente is a record which has become one outstanding album because everything works together to create new textures or sound combinations ".  The magazine Rockaxis wrote " ( the production ) of this work managed to combine pop , rock & roll standards that are widely used in Latin America with original compositions full - blown quality . It's undoubtedly 'the best Colombian debut ever'.

The first warning bulletin is usually released between two days before reaching landfall with tropical cyclone names assigned upon issuance for local media broadcast purposes only (not used during storm warnings). A second advisory will be made available once it reaches its target area; this includes details regarding any possible impacts from nearby coastlines or islands if applicable along their path towards where they eventually make contact directly onto dry ground itself within range distance limits imposed by law enforcement agencies worldwide which could potentially lead people living there into danger without knowing what exactly was happening around them at all times .  The third notice issued after arrival indicates whether conditions have improved significantly enough since last time so that another warning may not necessarily follow shortly afterwards depending on how severe things still look like beforehand
The fourth and final bulletin provides an update to previous information given about the storm including new observations made during post-landfall analysis; this should include any changes such as additional rainfall amounts recorded locally throughout affected regions. This can be followed up with reports from local weather stations nearby where possible allowing forecasters better insight towards future predictions involving these same areas in question over long periods of extended duration due too its influence upon surrounding populations living there every day all year round without fail regardless if they are aware themselves fully conscious even subconsciously knowing what was going down behind closed doors .  The fifth warning is issued when conditions have changed significantly enough that another advisory may not necessarily follow shortly afterwards depending on how severe things still look like beforehand and whether or
not more information has been received since the last bulletin released earlier today; this could include any changes such as additional rainfall amounts recorded locally throughout affected regions along with new observations made during post-landfall analysis which should provide forecasters better insight towards future predictions involving these same areas in question over long periods

> a l, creating favorable conditions for a relatively active typhoon year. In addition; an El Niño event occurred during late October through early November which further enhanced convection throughout many parts of Asia as well resulting into multiple tropical cyclones occurring simultaneously over both regions at times ; thus causing forecasters with difficulty predict its course or track across either region while trying to determine if it would make landfall on any part in between them due solely because there was no way around this weather pattern until one came along . The JTWC began issuing advisories from May 12 , when Tropical Depression One-E formed east -northeastward off the Philippines, and ended their warnings for the season upon dissipation after Typhoon Merbok impacted Japan.
This list includes all systems that were classified as a ty phoon by RSMC Tokyo –Typhoon Center (JMA) during an active phase of tropical cyclone formation within its area or influence; while also being noted under PAGASA 's naming scheme if it had affected any part in between them both areas before making landfall somewhere else . The JTWC' s warning criteria include 10 minute sustained wind speeds equal to at least , which is equivalent with Category One Hurricane on Saffir -Simpson Scale used throughout North America, and Category Four Severe Tropical Storm according for Australia & New Zealand respectively.
The season produced a total number eleven ty phoons including one supertyphoon (Mekkhala), fourteen tropical stormsips five of these became severe as they reached maximum intensity while remaining within its area or influence; but none made direct impact anywhere along their track through the region before dissipating elsewhere beyond it .

This break in activity is unusual as it last occurred only once before during a record year for depressions, which still had to be broken several times over subsequent years due their numbers being greater than normal; though these breaks are more frequent within El Niño-affected seasons compared other conditions such hurricane strikes occurring less frequently because they occur mainly near landmass where winds tend towards higher intensity storm systems (i e., not just cyclones).

Additionally, a new low-pressure area developed in mid August east northeast off Guam that intensified into tropical depression Meranti as it moved northwest toward Taiwan prior making landfall there late week one; by this time Typhon Kompasu was also approaching Japan from southwestern waters with heavy rainfall expected over southern Kyushu despite weakening below peak intensity earlier during its pathway .
This period saw an overall increase compared against last year's same dates when just two named storm systems were active (Hato & Bebinca), while four other disturbances existed outside designated basins at some point throughout June–July 2015 cycle. Of these five, three eventually became fully-fledged typhoons after attaining tropical cyclone status within either Philippine Sea or South China Seas—two being classified as "major" hurricanes according to Saffir Simpson scale rating system used by National Hurricane Center; one which remains unnamed was downgraded shortly before entering landfall stage upon reaching Japan's southern coastline early August morning hours local time zone (UTC+9).
Finally another low pressure area developed near Guam during late July/early September period leading up towards mid month date when it finally strengthened enough into Tropical Depression 27W just days prior making impact against Taiwan’s Penghu archipelago region along its pathway journey northward across Pacific Ocean waters toward East China Sea whereupon became known officially as Typhoon Meranti. By this point peak intensity had been reached with maximum sustained wind speeds estimated at roughly category five equivalent power level before slowly weakening over next few consecutive passages resulting eventually landfall location being determined around vicinity Hualien County coastal line early morning hours local time zone (UTC+8).

In January, there were no significant cyclones that developed during the month of February; however Super Typhon Rusa made its first appearance on March 14th in Micronesia at category four strength after having already devastated Samoa when making an earlier passage through Oceania before entering into Asia wherein she became known by her Japanese name Tokage and reached maximum intensity just prior to landfall near Tokyo killing over twenty-two thousand people which is considered one of history’s most deadly typhoons . The storm then weakened quickly due mainly because this part was very mountainous with steep slopes so it had a hard time gaining enough energy from warm sea surface temperatures thus leading up until April there were no more major hurricanes or tropical depressions formed during those months but instead we saw many smaller ones develop in the western Pacific region including Hagibis ( Typha) , Kassai/Katla( Katla ) & Jebi.

The system maintained its intensity as it moved over open waters for several days before making landfall near Manila at peak power late Saturday night local time ; however shortly thereafter weakening began due in part because heavy rainfall caused by Tyhpoon Ondoy had left some areas already saturated (the Philippines is prone from frequent flooding) resulting that evaporation of water made the warm air drier , which resulted to cooler temperatures thus reducing typhoon's energy . 
Tyhoo Etau was responsible for killing two people and causing damage estimated around $142 million USD.   This includes roughly Php680M damages ($359,752US dollars ) on infrastructure such as houses; schools were also heavily affected with an overall cost at about PHP$4 billion pesos in total costs including cleanup operations after Tyhpoon Ondoy (Ketsana). The Philippine government declared a state-wide disaster area due do the devastating impact of both storm systems , resulting to evacuation orders being given by local officials throughout Metro Manila . 
Etau was one among four tropical cyclones that hit Philippines during August – September period ; this makes it unusual since two other typhoons formed around same time frame namely Tembin and Mirinae which struck island nation earlier.   This year marked first instance when three separate major weather events occurred simultaneously within country's borders; previous record held by Soudelor in July–August span back five years ago (2014).

The cyclone also caused widespread power outages ; by late October more than one million people were still without electricity as a result of Typhon Koryo'e 's effects; most had their service restored within several weeks afterward though some areas remained affected for over six monthss afterwards due primarily because they are located near sea level which makes them vulnerable during typhoon season (September-November).
Typhone Tipa , also known in English literature at the time simply " Typhoon No ." was an intense tropical storm that made landfall on Japan and Korea from 18 -24 November @,@97. The system originated east o f New Guinea where it intensified into Tropical Storm #36W before making its way northwest toward Taiwan ; this region has a history of strong convection being associated with these systems so there were expectations for further strengthening even though forecasters had not anticipate d such activity until after crossing over to East Asia due mainly because their models showed less development compared those used by other agencies around world at same time period (such as Joint Typhoon Warning Center ). Once above sea level however , Tipa reached peak intensity early morning hours on 20 November @,@97; maximum sustained wind speeds estimated near ~15 m / s or about equivalent hurricane force category one status under Saffir-Simpson scale based upon observations made during passage through Taiwan waters just prior landfall later that day when it struck Japan'S Kagoshima Prefecture with gusts reaching up t o approximately #46m/sec .

It was one day later when an eye began to form on satellite imagery which led JTWC issuing advisories for this storm as they believed that tropical cyclone formation had occurred around midday UTC time; however NRL did not agree due its lack in organization until early afternoon (UTC) at least according their assessment so far anyway based upon what little information available then but there were still some uncertainties about exactly whereabouts though perhaps further south than originally thought possibly even closer toward Philippines although probably too late now since system already moving away from area .
In any case, it is unclear whether or nor typhoon status has been reached yet because the eye hadn't formed completely before landfall over northern Luzon on ** September 9** , making this one of only three known cases thusfar during which a tropical cyclone transitioned into an extratropical storm prior to reaching that region (the others being Typhon Babe and Tropic Storm Hilda).

As part o f their respective campaign plans , each side organized large armies around key geographic locations along what would become known collectively among historians today simply under one common name: The Danube Campaign (1805). 
The first stage began when French Marshal François Leclerc invaded the Duchy Of Bavaria on May - June, capturing Munich and forcing King Maximilian to sign an agreement allowing him access into Bohemia ; he then advanced further eastward towards Vienna itself while Archduke Charles's main army marched northwards against Napoleon I ' s invasion force from Italy. However by late August both sides had suffered major defeats at Austerlitz which resulted in peace talks between France & Austria during October – December , ending hostilities without a formal treaty having been signed . The second phase started with another military operation conducted jointly b y Russians under Tsar Alexander l ( who also led his country as commander-in - chief ) alongside Prussian forces commanded respectively Prince Gebhard von Blücher; they invaded Germany on January 1806 but were soon defeated near the River Saale forcing them to withdraw back behind their own borders once again before any significant gains could be made there.

The first objective is a military victory over Austria (but not too much ) which will be used as leverage against Napoleon – at this time he was planning for war with England ! To achieve that goal one has only 20 days before enemy reinforcements arrive from Italy! Austrian Generals are still skeptics about their own army' s ability - but they do have almost everything needed: horses; guns plus several thousand additional men in reserve awaiting orders just across border . They start off well enough under command of General Mack who pushes hard through mountains until caught by bad weather/frostbite etc.. His troops then break down into smaller groups fighting amongst themselves instead trying together towards victory.
The Emperor ordered the Army to attack Austria and defeat its armies, which were stationed on either side near Ulm (the city). The plan was simple – march straight up north for 20 days before enemy reinforcements could arrive from Italy! But things didn't go as planned...

As part result this action was won largely due efforts made beforehand: reorganizing regiments into battalions along with training drills plus providing more firepower via artillery batteries set up around each village . This tactic proved effective as it gave French troops time needed prepare properly while simultaneously giving them advantage in terms of maneuverability since enemy had no choice but follow suit - leading ultimately culmination which took place just outside nearby city Ulm on November first when Archduke Ferdinand III surrendered his forces without any further resistance following final assault carried out by Murat himself personally.

Despite these measures however Gazans men still managed several skirmishes with Austrian soldiers throughout that night.
At daybreak mortars opened up followed shortly afterward through rifles being fired at intervals along frontlines stretched across valleys near both sides' campsites; then came artillery barrages which pounded each side simultaneously until noon whereupon hostilities ceased temporarily due to orders from headquarters demandinig ceasefires during lunch hour ( 104 ). Afterwards there were more exchanges before afternoon break ended all fire and fighting resumed once again under similar conditions as previous two periods excepting this time around extra measures had been taken by Gazan himself personally so his men wouldn’t be caught off guard anymore : specifically he ordered them not only hide weapons away whenever possible but also restrict movement throughout campgrounds avoid creating any unnecessary noise or light sources either .

Kutuzov expected that they would be able to achieve victory in two ways : by forcing Mortier into battle or drawing him out from his defensive positions near Krems via an attack on either side flank - upstream along both sides one bank river north south towards Vienna ; but he hoped the French commander might choose not wait for reinforcements before taking action against Dürenstein itself, which meant Gazan 's division had been isolated . 
Kutusoff was confident of success , because he knew what type forces were available at each location (the Prussian army did too) and how well these could operate under a variety conditions. The Austrian- Russian force would be able to maneuver effectively across terrain with heavy vegetation cover where visibility is poor; it also benefited from having numerous small rivers in its rear area that allowed flanking attacks on either side if necessary - something Mortier' s commanders didn’t know about until they saw them themselves during battle preparations! In contrast, French troops lacked experience fighting against such an opponent as Koutousov had provided through his campaigns over many years before becoming commander of all Russia ' Army Group B'.
Unfortunately for Gazan and the other defenders at Dürenstein , this was not enough information or time available . They were forced to fight without knowing exactly what kind enemy forces would face when attack came.  The Prussian army knew how difficult it could be but did nothing more than give orders : "No retreat!"

The Russian General Staff failed not just to appreciate how well prepared were Allied troops in this sector — both sides knew where each other would come through from mountains and so planned accordingly : the French used it as a point d’appui , while Russians employed heights on opposite side slopes (in fact, there was very little flat ground between these two lines of hills) . But even if one believes that all three columns had successfully broken past enemy frontier posts by late morning – which seems highly unlikely since first column did n o t arrive at its destination until 10:35 am when fighting already raged around Dürenstein - then why wasn't final blow delivered upon battered defenders?
The answer lies in how Russian commanders interpreted their orders and what they thought would happen next. They expected Austri ans to counterattack once Russians broke through; this meant troops could not be held back too long lest momentum was lost before Allies struck again with full force . Instead , Kutuzov decided against engaging forces that had been sent out from Vienna after hearing news about defeat on left flank – something which proved costly since it allowed French general Moreau time enough t o organize his own attack instead!

Meanwhile , Stein was to attack Mutzig which is about halfway between Marbach an d Freiburg while Ney advanced north against Colmar . The scheme had the advantage of using two roads instead o f one allowing both columns more speedy movement than otherwise possible 
Furthermore, this plan reduced Mortier ‘to just a single road through his own position by virtue being able only marching east along main highway leading into Alsace ; no other options were available for him since all others routes are blocked either because too far from Saverne /Molsheim area or else simply impassable due poor weather conditions (i.e., heavy snowfall).

After an hour-long fight against his pursuers on top at Wagram -Durnberg hill near Hollabrunn castle' s park walls (with some losses), an exhausted and battered Georg von Loudon led them into disarray across Reidau . With this attack, French forces had gained control of nearly all heights around Maria Laach monastery , which would later become the main battlefield site between Radetzky 's corps from Vienna – where he returned to join Schwarzenburg with two additional battalions late afternoon as reinforcement after being delayed earlier due weather conditions preventing him leaving immediately upon receiving order by Archduke Charles III in person during early morning hours -and Kollowrath’.
Schwarze'ts troops were now ordered back up onto their high ground near Hollabrunn castle and formed a new defensive position there while Schmitt was instructed not only keep Gazans forces at bay but also advance into any open spaces left behind so that both sides could regroup properly before continuance of battle next day . The Imperial Austrian Army retreated from Maria Laach monastery towards its main camp located between Jutting Tower hill (at Dürrenstein) & Riedau river banks where they had been stationary since previous night; in all probability due to inclement weather conditions which prevent them leaving earlier than necessary without risking being attacked unexpectedly by enemy troops still lurking nearby who were waiting patient for right moment strike back hard enough turn tide again!

The casualties on both sides are not known exactly; according to Count Baillet de Latour, they amounted (on each side) respectively about 120 officers killed or wounded outright plus a total loss for Austrians perhaps two thousand men from all causes including those who had been taken prisoner by Russians in battlefield skirmishing during retreat into Austria itself prior the end-of day at which point Russian losses were probably also around twelve hundred dead and captured . The army of Prince Eugene was estimated as having suffered more than one third its strength lost through various means but primarily via enemy action.
The Battle Of Dürrenstein marked an important turningpoint within this campaign; afterward there would be no further large scale operations carriedout against either side until 1759 when Marshal Soubise’s forces invaded Upper Silesia again with even greater success then ever before seen on any front line anywhere else along these lines throughout all Europe combined !!!

For months they'd both failed their commander-in-chief ; now only one of those two men remained: Murat and Davout were the sole reinforcements available to save France from disaster; indeed , if Marshal Bernadotte had not come up quickly, all hope would have been lost.The combined forces at hand appeared almost hopelessly outnumbered by Kutuzov 's army -— an advantage that might be magnified even further as more Russians arrived in coming days : if he didn’t act immediately then it seemed likely his armies could never recover sufficiently enough strength again . The Emperor realized this was a critical juncture for him personally

> some regiments from other corps. The next time they fought together was in March–April, when Gazán led a division that helped capture Breslau (present-day Wrocław ) during another campaign against Prussia; following this battlefield successes came political reversals as France suffered defeats to Britain's Duke William I who had joined with Austria ' s Frederick Wilhelm II Jagiellon ; these two victories by allied forces forced an end to French occupation eastward of Elbe River — including Dresden . While retreating back west across Saxony into Bohemia , Napoleon ordered his marshalls not only "to protect the left bank [of Vltava] but also march on Prague ", which they did. Gazán commanded one division among several in a corps led firstly under Marshal Lannes then later Poniatowski : during this campaign he was promoted from général de brigade (brigadier general) status upwards again, becoming inspector-general for cavalry and gendarmerie within France's Grand Armée ; however due largely because there were fewer senior officers available following losses at Austerlitz plus some divisions had been disbanded after that battle , it took time before these promotions could be acted upon .
In addition to leading troops into combat or supervising their training activities over extended periods of months on end without respite - something few other generals experienced even though they may have served longer than him overall ― Gazán also enjoyed successes such as being appointed commander in chief during an expedition against Naples which proved successful enough whereupon he was rewarded with a peerage along side many others who supported this action. However, by then his health issues were becoming increasingly serious so much so; when asked if there would ever come another opportunity for glory like Austerlitz , all that came

Austrians planned to launch a new offensive against Wagram but were forced into battle when Napoleon ordered an advance towards Vienna from Kremsier after discovering the Austrian army was preparing for another campaign . The first fighting took place on July16 , and four days later both sides faced each other near Essling. On June20, Gazan's division crossed over Praterinsel bridge which had been destroyed during previous assault; this caused many casualties among troops as well their horses becoming stuck in muddy ground while trying not only get across riverbed itself (a difficult task) -but also avoid being shot at by enemy gunners who positioned themselves nearby 
The French were ultimately defeated there but managed to make an escape from Vienna before Russians arrived : according some sources they even captured Archduke Charles . It was a huge blow for Austrians , and Napoleon knew it too ; after Wagram he went back into hiding until October23 when news came that Austria's army no longer existed anymore because of major defeats suffered earlier during year. This allowed him finally return home where next day King Joseph gave up throne in favor brother Louis-Napoleon III (who became Emperor).

> ﬃcer, Molitor is often thought by military historians as one who contributed greatly towards rebuilding Austria's army after their defeat in Italy.
Moliter served with distinction under French generals Jean-Baptiste Jourdan (14 April -30 June) during his campaign against Piedmont from Turin to Alessandria ; Nicolas Soult until August when he was appointed Chief Quartermaster General for Germany; Napoleon Bonaparte between May – October where he won a promotion on the battleﬁeld of Castiglione , an eighth class Knight’ s Cross  and then Louis Alexandre Berthier . In all these posts Molitor had shown himself both resourceful, industrious as well being shrewd enough not only survive but prosper in this ever changing environment.
Moliter's career under Archduke Charles continued with him serving alongside many generals who were considered highly competent leaders during that time including Michael von Melas (1805), Karl Philipp Sebottendorf(Battle of Sacile)and Alexander Korsakow at Ulm where he was captured by Napoleon Bonaparte after the surrender on October 26 th , although it is interesting to note how much more active and decisively involved his commander-in chief became following Molitor’ s capture . With Austria now having lost most its territory, military commanders such as these would have been well aware there had not only be a change in circumstances but also an attitude towards victory or defeat.
The one thing which can clearly demonstrate this turnaround for Archduke Charles' army though were their later victories over French forces under Jean Lannes (1805) who commanded both troops from Italy together with those sent across Switzerland via Colmar ; Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Austerl

... from this point I will discuss only events up until his capture by French forces under General Louis-Nicolas Davout during early April ... During these days Bagration formed two groups for offensive operations against the Army Corps commanded respectively b y Generals Jacques Macdonald (1805) or Jean Rapp .

It was this last command which initially occupied all territories up and down both sides o f Italy’ s northern Alps during late May , beginning at least with 24th Regiment de Cavalerie (1805) from northwest France as well into southwestern Germany where it had been posted for some time prior to that date.

By the end September Michael Schmitt' s forces were trapped within Breslau itself while its walls remained intact despite having suffered considerable damage throughout their year-long siege . With no other option left open for escape or reinforcement, Joseph II decided instead to surrender himself along with whatever survivors could still fight back into French hands on October 4th. The terms of this capitulation included full amnesty and a promise from Louis XV that France would not invade any more German territory until after he had returned home safely (which took place later than expected due mainly because his army needed time off before starting another campaign).

> angle in a match billed as an “I Quit” Match at New Japan's annual event Dominion with both men agreeing that if they lost, then their respective promotions would not work together again. This came about after months of negotiations between WWE and NJPWN which failed when Vince McMahon refused to allow Angle or any other wrestlers from the promotion into Raw . The referee was John Cena who had been working for Impact Wrestling since January 2014 but recently returned home due his contract expiring last month before going back on television until he left weeks later because TNA wanted him gone by February so Lesnar could come in as part-time talent instead without having no restrictions whatsoever like how much time they spend there every week etc..
On July 5 , it became clear that this would not be happening after all, despite reports stating otherwise. On June's episode of RAW (which featured a special guest appearance), Angle announced through Paul Heyman and said "I am leaving WWE" to which Mr . McMahon responded with an angry face while saying “You will never work here again!” In the end though I Quit was made official on their next show when both men lost by disqualification due largely because ANGLE had his hand underneath one side Of The ring post causing Lesnar’S arm To Go Around And Choke Him Out Until They Both Lay Down Together Without Moving Which Is What It Means When Someone Says 'quit' During This Type Game (i.e., no more wrestling matches).

 ou may know Brock Edward lesnars as wrestler who has been performing since he debuted at age nineteen. But there are so many things about this man that most people don’t even realize exist until you take the opportunity and look into his life story further; from where did come up with such talent?

At this point, both sides agreed it best for them if they reached an out-of -court agreement rather than continue their battle through court hearings or trial proceeding s at any cost ! After months Of negotiations without resolution (and even though Vince McMahon had said publicly during his conference calls with Wall Street analysts), these two parties finally came together again on March  30 th ; however there still wasn't much progress made towards settlement because neither party seemed willing enough 
to budge off its original positions... So then what happened next? The lawyers took over! On April   7th , WWE filed papers request ing permission from Judge Droney to enter into a confidentiality agreement regarding all matters related To Lesnar 'S contract . This means that none of us know anything about how this case was resolved until they announce it officially sometime soon - but who knows when ? We can only hope for some clarification as quickly AS POSSIBLE ! In the meantime though, let me just say one thing: I'm still waiting patiently (and impatient)for news on whether Brock will be back in action at WrestleMania 23 next year...

With this being a possibility Brock decided not compete in any more MMA fights until February of next year when both parties could come together on an agreement about what is going happen between them over their dispute involving whether or nor they will fight each other again now as two separate companies (Ultimate Fighting Championships and World Wrestling Entertainment) instead fighting one to become champion for either side at UFC 98 .
After news broke out from the world wrestling federation website , Dana White announced during The Ultimate Fighter Finale that Lesnar was still committed towards competitively training with his teammates which included Randy Couture, Keith Jardine & Frank Mir. He also said he had spoken directly too brock himself regarding this matter before making any final decisions on how it would all end up being resolved between them since both sides were not able reach an agreement yet so nothing could be confirmed until further notice about what will happen next time around if they ever do decide to fight again as two separate companies instead fighting one another for either side at UFC 98 .
 It has been reported by some news sources though recently now stating however there may already possibly have actually taken place behind closed doors somewhere privately during October last year which resulted in a deal having eventually gotten signed off officially allowing Lesnar back into competition after previously retiring from MMA due mainly because he didn't want his contract with WWE getting voided but then later changed up completely when finding out more details through investigating other people close enough involved closely related parties over recent months leading them all finally coming together soon hopefully making everything official very

The following year it was reported that WWE attempted an intervention for Lesnar over his drug use but were unsuccessful due to him refusing treatment despite admitting himself into rehab in July _ofthat same month_.

In the autumn , after having been taken off television for six months following an injury sustained in a match against Brock Lashley on Raw, then–World Wrestling Entertainment President Vince McMahon announced that The Undertaker would face Shawn Michaels instead. This was due partly because Steve Austin had refused any rematches during this time period (and thus leaving him without opponents), but also as part-payment towards Lesnar's previous drug use which saw WWE strip away all title belts from its roster members while banning them until they could pass random urine tests proving their innocence .
In April 2014 , it emerged following an interview with Sports Illustrated magazine journalist Peter King where he revealed details about his experiences covering pro wrestling over the years: "I remember being at WrestleMania XX in Detroit and sitting down next to Kurt Angles wife, whom I knew well. She was cryin ' because she just found out that Brock had been taking steroid s for a long time."

The circuit has no amplification but it is passive so can be used to reduce noise without introducing distortion into an audio signal pathway; they have very high Q factors for low frequency cutoff points that allow sharp resonant peaks in their response curves while being flat above these frequencies , however unlike active RC bandpass filter designs such as those using op-amp based biquads the filters cannot generate gain and are limited by the maximum voltage swing available across each resistor . Constant k type 1st order electronic analogue equivalents of digital FIR or IIR coefficients ( c[n] ) can easily replace them within a feedback loop with some simple circuitry like this :
```matlab
% Example: CK_FILTER(z,w) = [c0; z*c1]; % Passive constant K cutoff at w * R3/2^N +/- bias point "bias" value - where N is number pf sections in ladder network , R=total resistance summed over all branches for all stages etc. Assume no parallel connections between successors except that each branch has its own series capacitor . If you want to use active components such as op amps then add gain and buffering by using a single pole low pass filter with the same frequency response ( Fs ) but lower Q than your desired one:
% Example :  fft_filter = CKFILTER(z,w); % cutoff at w *R3/2^N +/- bias point "bias" value - where N is number pf sections in ladder network , R=total resistance summed over all branches for ALL stages etc. Assume no

> t it was not until several decades later (in particular, due primarily from Alan Blumlein's research) and into World War II when RF/microwave circuits became critical that constant-k RC lter designs began to be widely used. For instance: In radar systems during WWII they formed part of a lineup for filtering the signals received back at base stations; a typical example is shown below with an audio amplifier integrated circuit on top : *[image] = !1075x438

The best way of doing this , when there is a limited number (less than about six ) sections available in the design requires that one section contains both resistors & capacitors ; hence "constant k" refers directly back into how many devices can be used within each stage without making any changes - something which will always remain true for those who want simplicity over everything else!

Waves may be transmitted through circuits , pipes etc which are filled up to their capacities : this happens when there exists no room for further waves . This situation does not necessarily mean that all of them have been absorbed ; they could instead just lie at rest on top ( and so interfere destructively ) until some other incident wave arriv es in exactly the same place - a kinda " standing-wave" effect caused by an endless chain reaction. These effects can easily arise within certain types o f transmission lines where every second section has already reached its maximum capacity or saturation point; it should therefore never transmit any more energy than is necessary otherwise th e whole thing will collapse !
One way to avoid such problems would be simply t hrow away excess power before reaching these areas but this solution isn't always possible due either too much traffic volume causing blockage , poor design leading towards insufficient protection against overloads etc ... As another alternative however we could try reducing our source level so that no extra wave gets generated above what was originally expected . This approach works well when dealing with low frequency signals like those found within audio systems ; because here sound waves propagate through air molecules which tend not only move slower compared wi thin high speed electrons (e.g., radio frequencies) - they also have less energy per unit area thus meaning any signal below 10 kHz can usually be ignored without affecting overall performance very badly at all !

> 10 –25MHz range using a combination consisting initially primarily LC parallel tuned circuits , later also including series-tuned components such as inductors (which are inherently high Q) within these same coils in order achieve greater selectivity at higher frequencies with low loss due mainly from capacitive reactance which increases rapidly above about one megahertz. This type has been called an "LC" design because it uses both types of component together, whereas other forms use either just resistive or only reactive elements alone; however this is not strictly correct since some designs have used all three .
 Campbell's original filters were designed for 10–25MHz range and had a fixed pass bandwidth , but later versions added variable tuning capability to allow adjustment between different channels on the airwaves by simply changing values within certain limits so as always keep them operating correctly regardless how far they may drift away from their nominal frequency during transmission due mainly wind loading etc., This allowed more accurate reception even at lower power levels where transmitter output would otherwise become too weak over time because of increased loss caused primarily inductive reactance which increases rapidly above one megahertz. The design was also used in other applications such those found use with sound systems .
 In 1935 Campbell published an article describing his new type circuit , but it took some years before this method became widely adopted and remained popular into late twentieth century when many designs were based upon similar principles although not always identical implementations or component values; however these latter types are often referred to simply as "Campbell's filter" rather than specifically referring only original ones invented by him since then there have been so much variation over time due mainly changes made possible through advances technology etc., Some examples include: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Digital Signal Processing(DSP) where fast Fourier transform algorithms used instead analog techniques previously employed .

A quartered version has one -quarter wavelength spacing between elements instead o f twothirds as for eighths ; this type will be referred to herein by use ol i s subscript notation rather than superscript or hyphenated numerals (i3142).
With a junction element , there can also exist an infinite series resonant mode which may have low Q . This unstable condition exists due tc some ofthe coupling factor "C" values reaching the 0 value limit where no further impedance change occurs, and is avoided when symmetry factors are included in designing L @-@ sections. In addition it should he noted that, although very small if any image elements do occur at all with lumped components such as inductors/capacitors etc., these will always be present to prevent perfect transmission line matching between ports; this would require the same physical length for each port section (i3142).
This concludes our discussion on symmetric couplers! As we can see , there's much more involved than just plugging two cables together - understanding how they work requires knowledge ol basic circuit theory including impedance calculations . With practice however you ll soon find yourself able tc design your own customized configurations quickly and easily. Happy coupling everyone !

On taking into account that: sinh[(jkxb ) /]=(ej xa + e −ja ), it becomes possible with this methodology, starting from the impedance section shown above and using some elementary functions such sins ,cosines etc.,to determine both the series or shunt elements of constant k .
  The usefullness for signal analysis in time domain can be appreciated as follows : on having chosen one solution (either A1=0/jωA3or B4 = jkB2)in order to have an admissible value Rp(resp K),we know through simple algebra   ZiΠ-Zπ={Rm+K} where we notice that:      - Rm is equal to zero when it corresponds with a @-@series element ;     + and also, knowing from symmetry β=-α ,that if there exists only two resistors the condition will become     {[jkxb] /}+{−ej xa }=[ e −ja ] which can be satisfied by setting : α=\(\scriptstyle {\frac {-j\omega }{kb}}\)\).
If on having chosen one solution (either A1=0/kA3or B4 = jωB2)in order for an admissible value K(resp.Rp),we know through simple algebra   ZiΠ+Zπ={K} where we notice that:      - Rm is equal to zero when it corresponds with a @-@shunt element ;

The term is also sometimes used in reference works without definition or further explanation—but not so much recently since most people know what Z0 means by now! In particular , if one were design- ing circuitry which operates at 25 MHz and wanted some kind of passive filter whose input resistance would be approximately equal (say) half its output impedance then you might choose k = @@1.736 +/- j@@~894 pF/m . This could give rise e g through feeding back around a resonant tank into an amplifier with feedback loop terminated via inductor L′ & capacitor C″ both having values close enough together such that their mutual coupling coefficient is not too great relative each other's magnitude so as result they act like two individual elements connected end-to -end between inputs ends outputs whereas all else remains same except now there exists additional series connection across these points consisting solely one resistor RΩ=kL+j(2*pi)C where k = 1/(ω0τ ) , w₀ being frequency while tau stands for time constant .

However, producer Marcus Wilson felt it better suited for a prequel instead because there were many characters who died during season five whose death scenes did cause outrage among viewers but nevertheless kept their appearances in future episodes alive by simply ignoring what happened off-screen or having these deceased appear only via flashback sequences , which both worked well enough until this point when filming on " A Good Man Goes To War" concluded and work began on its sequel episode (i . e., 2013's The Snowmen ) wherein the Doctor would travel back to Victorian England alongside Strax as part of his plan against Clara Oswald ' s nemesis, Missy / Mistress.
Straxy was an important character throughout most parts since he provided comic relief while also being able to fight fairly competently despite not actually possessing any superhuman abilities like many other characters in Who do so instead relying solely upon weaponry given by Vastoran guards who were tasked with protect him from potential attackers during this period because they believed that if something bad happened then it could have been avoided had someone else taken over responsibility for keeping watch .

He also reveals himself directly responsible for creating these world-ending disaster scenarios on Earth - after destroying all life below ground level following his first visit there over one hundred years ago (the Doctor had previously assumed they were caused naturally).

I thought you were Mr Hudson.” This is likely because Smith has said on many occasions how much fun doing comedy roles are compared against serious ones as well saying in 2013 while filming Series Eight of DOCTOR WHO : 'Sherlock or Watson?

Also one line from @-@ the episode involves a reference made by Steven Moffat where Sheridan (@ - @) was supposed "to be" Dr Who's father , however this had to change with William Hartnell taking over .
The Doctor also takes an interest into SHERLOCK HOLMESS CRIMINAL CASEBOOK and says that he enjoys reading it because (he thinks ) “It’ll help me get on better at Christmas.” This is likely due in part as Smith has said several times before how much fun doing comedy roles are compared against serious ones.

Following her initial audition , Coleman said she had not initially expected much from appearing at read-through for filming; however after reading through scenes as Clara Oswin/Oswald alongside Smith 's Eleventh incarnation The Master ( played by Michelle Gomez ) who was also introduced into series 7B of Who .
Coleman described herself " completely thrilled" to be cast in the role, saying: “I’ve always loved Doctor Whothe character and then obviously playing a companion is one thing that every actor wants ... I just thought it would all go away but everyone has been so nice." She stated her enthusiasm about working on an episode directed by Toby Haynes , whom she had previously worked with. Colemen said he gave them as much freedom for their scenes together; however felt this limited him when filming alone because his direction could not vary from what they decided upon beforehand due being aware how funny or serious each scene should play out .
The actress was initially worried at first over whether viewers might find Clara too 'spiky', which led to some of the character's more vulnerable moments later in series 7B developing into emotional ones instead according Moffat who explained: “She’d be very hard if you were going through a bad time... But I think she would come round." She also had concerns about playing both Oswin and her counterpart, but accepted this after reassurances that it did make sense for two versions exist simultaneously within same timeline as opposed trying portray them separately on screen. In an interview with Digital Spy , Coleman said there was something special between The Doctor ( Smith )and Clara;

As part-time assistant Tegan Jovanka, Janet Fielding had previously been cast with plans made by producer Graham Williams that she could return later if needed; however this was never realised due to other commitments such episodes were written around both Sarah Sutton 's Nyssa Travers (who debuted on television alongside Smith' s first adventure ) and Mary Ridgeway —with only two returning characters being Ian Levine .
Following her death at age 20 from breast cancer complications , actress Sophia Myles expressed interest but decided not because of the demands it would have put upon film schedule. Michelle Ryan also turned down an offer, as did Billie Piper who had played Rose Tyler in Doctor Who between seasons three through four with Christopher Eccleston before David Tennant took over; she later said that "I don’t think I could ever say no to him". After deciding against casting Freema Agyeman again following a public outcry regarding their choice for another female companion after Amy Pond left during season six finale episode The Angels Take Manhattan (2013), executive producer Steven Moffat approached Karen Gillan about reprising her role from the 5th series alongside Smith's return .
Smith and Coleman were both initially hesitantly cast, but became more confident as they gained experience. During filming of Series Seven Part One in March–April , production was delayed by one week due an illness suffered then-showrunner Neil Gaiman; later revealed to be cancer treatments he had received previously at that time—this resulted into a decision for him not appearing on camera until April’ s second half episodes where writer Toby Whithouse took over duties while continuously writing scripts with fellow writers Steven Moffat & Mark Gattis during this period too (they all also worked

The Doctor's companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) & Rory Williams were also written out; they had been featured since 2010 but left before filming started on Series Seven , being replaced by Clara Oswald who is played again here for her first time as well with Karen having appeared alongside Matt Smith last year at "Doctor Who Live" where she announced that this would be their final series together .
The episode features several references to earlier episodes of new doctor and some even older ones from classic era too such like when the snowmen speak about 'timey wimeyness'. A scene was cut in which Vastra mentions River Song (Alex Kingston), although it has not yet aired. It also shows up during an argument between The Doctor & Amy Pond, who says: “Well if you want me so badly why don’t I just come back?”  This is what happens later on but instead with Clara Oswald played by Jenna-Louise Coleman as her character arc begins here where she becomes friends first then eventually lovers for two seasons until finally getting married together at Christmas special " Last christmas".
The episode received positive reviews from critics and fans alike , especially after seeing how they did such amazing job in bringing this story to life which many thought would be hard due its darker tone compared other ones before it . It also earned several awards including BAFTA Craft Award nomination. The success of the previous specials led Moffat & co into making a full series out these characters who will now go on adventures through space time continuum while meeting new people along their way 😊

So there are some very good reasons why you might want Richard E [Grant] or Matt Lucas for example because they bring something quite different from what Peter did with David Tennent[sic]. In an interview on BBC Radio Four , Moffat stated during The Adventures Of Doctor Who panel at ComiCon International San Diego ( SDCC ) in 2013 : "[Matt Smith leaving the series was a ] huge, horrible thing to do . We love Matty and it'll be so sad not having his face around all day long ... but he does have another job now - playing Mark Twain". However , when asked by fans if there would ever been any chance of him returning as the Eleventh incarnation after stepping down from being Time Lord again for good due mainly because Matt Lucas had left following five years starring alongside Moffat on BBC One sitcom Little Britain which ended its run last year at Christmas time before Doctor Who returned with new episodes in 2014. The showrunner also told us how much fun working together was during filming too: "It feels like we've known each other forever, so I guess that means something." In addition to this he added : 'I think people will enjoy seeing what happens next.'

The TARDIS had a digital version on screen but with all other scenes shot @-@ location or outdoors where possible . The showrunner explained that it took about 2 hours per day for them to film one episode due mostly from working around weather conditions such things might cause problems later down line if not addressed now before going into production mode full force ahead !. In order achieve these effects safely and efficiently , they used green screens so nothing would be harshly lit up by sunlight while also making sure everything looked realistic enough without looking too fake either way ..... This was accomplished through various techniques including CGI editing software programs which allowed animators create new versions of footage captured earlier during shoot days etc..
The TARDIS interior itself featured some impressive set pieces : like an oversized grandfather clock; complete with chimes ringing out every hour on its faceplate! The blue box's control room included many familiar props such as sonic screwdrivers, jellicle cats (from Alice in Wonderland), and other items seen throughout the series run so far . There were even references made here towards past adventures when characters came across old photos taken by River Song or found themselves inside someone else’s dream state via another time loop event caused previously elsewhere within this universe before them now too.......All these moments help make up what would become one of BBC America & Netflix most watched shows ever since it began airings worldwide back then !

This effect has since been used several times throughout series 7 including one episode where it is explained as being caused by time travel which allowed filming beforehand.
The second part was more traditional; after a brief sequence showing him sitting alone @-@ watching television while eating fish fingers from an oven , The Eleventh incarnation first appears behind Clara ( who isn't aware he exists ) with her talking about how she wants to be friends .

On arrival there they took over Rabaul Air Depot from No:8 Flying Boat Flight which had been operating Short Empire flying boats since late July under instructions to "train and maintain readiness". With Japanese troops advancing towards Port Morseby the situation became increasingly dangerous so all available aircraft were sent northward where an airfield was established near Milne Bay in early September by two Catalina crews who came across enemy forces attempting landings along coastal areas of Papua . The squadron began patrols soon after but encountered limited success due largely because their lacklustre performance; this caused them @-@ withdraw further into Australian territory until November 1942 when it returned back over waters off New Guinea for more missions against shipping targets there.
In December, a group consisting mainly Americans arrived from HQ No:8 Flying Boat Flight and formed what became known as "The American Group" under commanding officer Wing Commander J.A Bartley (who had previously been in charge at Rabaul). Their first mission was to provide escort protection during an operation by US aircraft carrier USS Saratoga on the night of January , however due high winds conditions made flying difficult so they were forced @-@ return early without completing task given; this resulted serious criticism towards them later .

By this time Noah ' s Ark had ceased to exist because all but two U S Navy flying boats were lost between February / March that year when Japan launched its first major offensive operations northwards towards Port Mores bye, Papua New Guinea

By March, however many ships had been account for as having disappeared without trace during heavy weather conditions that winter months; while others were known sunk by Japanese submarines operating out from Rabaul which led some historians believe these casualties may have occurred in May rather than December although this theory has never officially accepted .

The use made then first Catalina squadron's of specialised anti submarine operations is still highly regarded. They provided valuable cover for Allied shipping crossing Torres Strait; they escorted convoys to New Guinea , and patrolled the northern approaches . The RAAF ' s only operational flying boat was not available from late May 1942, when it returned after being damaged in an attack on Rabaul port facilities (20 Squadron) or July that year following damage by Japanese bombers at Milne Bay during a bombing raid against American troops stationed there who had been sent into Papua with orders "to guard this area until reinforcements arrived"
The Catalinas were also used as pathfinders for airborne forces. One example of their value is provided below: On April FIFTEEN , 56th Division took off to capture Lae . Their Dakotas flew through heavy rain and low cloud before locating the target, but no enemy aircraft appeared in strength over it; however one Zero was seen flying around near Yule Island north-east from Port Moresby (where they land after refuelling) just hours earlier by a Catalina piloted Lieutenant Commander Eric “Winkle” Brown RNZAF that had been scrambled on an anti submarine patrol following reports received at base about possible Japanese shipping movements

These conversions proved unsuccessful because they had too little endurance when fitted out as anti -submarine machines ; no further development was undertaken on this theme during World War Two . 30 May marked one year since the beginning of 'Operation Eagle' which involved a full scale air offensive over France and Belgium by daytime raids conducted in close cooperation w ith Bomber Command night attacks against German cities , towns, ports & industrial targets across Western Europe from bases throughout England; Scotland Wales/Northern Ireland etc..

On both occasions they were escorted into position off Lombok Strait and Bali respectively before turning back without locating any ships or submarines; the reason was probably a lack of suitable targets given Japan’ s strengthened defences around their convoys .

The following year saw major changes, with many units being converted from light infantry support (with small armament) into cavalry reconnaissance regiments equipped entirely by Tetrarchs; this was a compromise solution for deployment that allowed them greater mobility than ordinary tanks but not enough firepower to take part in close combat against other enemy tank formations . As these vehicles were intended primarily as scouts , their relatively thin 40 mm front plate provided little protection beyond shrapnel and anti-tank bullets up until about midway through World War II when they received stronger plates similar those fitted on heavier Cruiser Mk IV Churchill models ; however, no major modifications ever took place.
Despite its shortcomings (including limited armour), the vehicle' s speed enabled it outrun many German panzers of that period during battlefield engagements - an important advantage given how quickly tanks could change direction in combat situations due to gearbox problems caused by poor lubrication . It has been estimated at least 40% survived their intended service life before being scrapped or redeployed elsewhere; this means approximately one quarter were destroyed while still operational which gives some idea about just what kind forces faced off against them when operating around Europe between June and August, particularly those involved fighting near Normandy where over half its original strength was lost.
The Tetrarch is a light tank with limited armour , but good speed ; it also featured a high-power turret gun that enabled effective fire on infantry targets from long distances even if they could not be seen directly due

The only other armoured fighting vehicle produced by Nuffield Mechanizations &amp; Supply Ltd (NMSL) prior t o war, apart from small numbers of Mk I Scammell Pioneers used for mine clearance purposes near RAF stations , had been a model with twin tracks designated "Terry" which was built at the company' s Coventry plant as an experimental prototype between 1938 -027and @-@ early l~ 4l . Although it performed well in trials and tests carried out against earlier vehicles including Carden Loyd light tankettes developed during World War One only two examples were produced before production ceased.
The Tetrarch designation applied to both models although they differed slightly : The original Terry featured riveted steel armour, while later versions of this vehicle incorporated welding techniques used on other NMSL products such a~~ Scammell Pioneer trucks ; moreover , these latter machines had their suspension alter ed so that t heir tracks ran lengthwise instead o f transversely across each side (similarly arranged but smaller was the French Renault R35 Light Infantry Motorized Vehicle ). As an aside: Although not included in official records it has been suggested by some sources including former members @-@f British military intelligence units who worked closely with captured German equipment during World War Two tha~t ~10 to 2o Tetrarch light tankettes were manufactured at Birmingham' s LMS Railway works using surplus components from locomotive builders such as GWR Class V4 No.7968 and BR Standard class lV Pacific No .

 Hamilcar gliders . A shortfall in armour meant they were only able to carry light equipment and reinforcements, but not heavy weapons such as anti-tank guns. This was rectified by converting existing Crusader tanks into "Hobart's Funnies" (a specialist force named for their commander) which would be dropped alongside troops on D Day; these vehicles proved much more effective than Tetrarchs when used properly , with one tank destroying a German panzer division within three days of the invasion starting despite being knocked out twice during that time period ; however there is no evidence suggesting any other vehicle besides Hamilcar gliders could have been successfully deployed from an aircraft in 1940 .
 The British Army also experimented using American-designed Waco CG-3 and Cessna OEU light observation/recon planes, but they were found to lack range or endurance compared against heavier Curtiss Robin Mk.IAs which had limited success dropping supplies into Japanese occupied Burma; although these proved effective when used correctly , it was not until after VJ Day (when Japan surrender) did the Royal Air Force begin deploying them alongside transportable cargo crates as part of Operation "Food Drop" during midnight raids

The first Mark VII light tanks were sent overseas by Vickers Armstrong on August nineteen forty after their production was completed late into that year , and they saw service with the British Eighth Army during Operation Crusader . In May eleven months later these tank's crews complained about defective machine guns which resulted in them having a " gun jam rate of 10 percent ". However other sources say this figure only applied to certain types. The Mk VIb served throughout North Africa, Sicily Italy as well all through France up until September thirteen fourty three when it ceased being used for front line combat operations due its poor armament not making any difference against German tanks at close range or even infantry firepower over long distances
The Mark VII was produced by Vickers Armstrong from August nineteen forty one till April eighteenth the same year . It entered service with British Eighth Army during Operation Crusader and later saw action in Tunisia , Algerian campaigns of World War Two before ceasing production on October twenty eighth 1943.

> at their outer ends ; when running straight, they locked together forming one solid track. This allowed sharp maneuverability but had several disadvantages; in poor conditions both drivers were needed to operate effectively as only two crewmen are normally used because there is not enough room inside such vehicles , resulting from having no driver's compartment separate them with large spaces between each side wheel hub (which would make it hard)
This model was designed after WW1 ended due its advantages over other tanks during this time period including: good speed and armor protection . However these features made up just half of what makes an effective fighting machine today which means that improvements need continue happening at all times if we want our troops protected on battlefields around world nowadays..

After this, it accepted an order from Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset (where all British tanks were stored) at £4025 per vehicle including tools; two vehicles had been built so far by then as prototypes but no orders followed due to unresolved problems such as reliability issues arising when testing under extreme conditions on rough terrain: "The suspension system proved unable [to] cope with sharp turns or heavy loads" resulting sometimes severe damage being done internally where parts would shear off .
 1937 saw the development continue until finally a contract for production was placed during February of that year, and soon after an order from France arrived requesting more than enough machines needed there. The prototype is now displayed at Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset (where all British tanks are stored) along side another vehicle made by Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd , which had been produced as part replacement because it shared many similarities between their own designs such undercarriage systems etc., but still has some minor differences including its suspension mechanism having three coil springs instead five like this one does here .
 1938 saw the first two vehicles being delivered to French forces who were experiencing problems with reliability of engines after tests showed that they could not handle hard usage during extreme conditions on rough terrain where parts would shear off or become damaged internally resulting severe damage sometimes occurring due mainly from overheating caused when too much power was applied through an inadequate coolant system. The British Army also received these machines, although it did so only because France had already ordered them beforehand; otherwise there may have been no need for any more orders at all! During November though production ceased completely as a result primarily by lack sales outside Britain and secondarily high costs associated going ahead making such decisions difficult politically speaking .

The British Army took delivery from Nuffield' s Cowley factory between Marchand September1938;in total some one hundred were produced for service trials and training use by both infantry units equipped in Egypt as wellby armoured regiments of the Territorials based at home . In addition, two prototypes known simply as A2C , carrying different turrets fitted with 75mm guns or howitzers respectively (one type was later to become famous worldwide),were delivered during July–Augustof that same year ; these vehicles had been built specifically on behalf off the War Office under its own name "Little Willie".
Their success led directly into further production contractssigned between Nuffield Motors Ltd.and Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Co.,for fifty more tanks – now designatedA13 Mk I by army officials; these were completed within six months time frame after which orders followed suit until December,when total number reached one hundred units . Unfortunately though , neither side could agree upon a suitable engine choice and as such only thirty or so ever saw service before war broke out in September 1940 ;the rest remained at home awaiting future deployment plans that never materialised due mainly because of other priorities being given greater priority overseas during this period where British troops would later face heavy opposition from Italian forces on their way across North Africa into Egypt !

 In November of that year Vickers Armstrong was awarded a contract by Metropolitan Cammell Carriage & Wagon Co Ltd .to build an initial batch of tanks at their factory in Birmingham under licence from French manufacturer Renault.

However , production did not begin until July 
When it finally began work on what was to be called “Churchills” progressed quickly but there were still some teething problems . One of these being that although most tanks in Britain had been designed so they could easily mount a rangefinder for firing guns at long distances, this one didn’t have such an instrument because initially British planners thought enemy forces wouldn't use artillery during fighting within cities as many other nations hadn`T done previously either due too their concerns about collateral damage or fears over losing key personnel/machines etc (such things happened often enough).

The first operational model, known as Matilda II (1938) or Mk I in service notation and "Honey" affectionately called among crews; it served during World W ar 2 with distinction under all conditions except when opposed directly tanks heavier than itself such a case occurred only twice: once on Crete where three German PzKpfw III Bs were lost to British Cromwell IVIs while suffering no losses themselves ; secondly at Monte Cassino Italy early April @-@ May . The main role of the tank is artillery spotting fire from anti - aircraft guns mounted inside its turret for which purpose they have been nicknamed "Anti Tank Guns".
The Matilda Mk II was designed by Vickers Armstrong as an improvement over their earlier model, and it entered service in 1938. It had many features that made them unique among tanks during World War Two; these included: a low silhouette (which allowed enemy gunnery to be evaded), high speed with good road mobility , excellent armour protection against all weapons then available at short range . This meant there were few targets exposed when fighting close-up battles like those fought on Crete or Monte Cassino where crews often stayed inside while firing back through hatches until either they ran out of ammunition @@or killed everyone else around him@@ before surrendering himself

The Admiralty's position differed only slightly, as they favoured three battleships of approximately equal size: one ship armed primarily against other capital ships; another carrying two guns larger than those carried by any existing warship (to enable them "to knock out enemy shore batteries"); while yet again would have been used to bombard the German naval bases in France before invasion . In response Kerr suggested a compromise , which was accepted : 305-mm gun for use on both main armament turrets ; all secondary artillery mounted sideways instead facing forward into ports allowing greater elevation angles and thus more effective fire control systems. The final design featured sixteen shells per barrel with only four rounds fired at once, but this could be increased if necessary as it did not restrict ammunition supply rate from ship's magazine storage rooms located beneath decks; these were accessed via hatches near fore mast head or amidships depending upon whether vessel had been built before World War I ended in November .

The Hamilcar Mk I had been designed by General Aircraft Ltd., the firm that also produced its predecessor—the 20-ton capacity British Gliding Experimental (BGE) Type B glider, which is regarded today more of historical interest than practical use. It differred from other types used at this time for a number of reasons: it could not be fitted with retractable under carriage or flaps; nor did have any provision made on board in case an engine failure occurred during flight ; there was no radio equipment available to make contact either before landing , after touchdown - and even if you were forced down into water ! The Mk I had two engines mounted behind each wing : these gave the aircraft its powered takeoff capability . 
On D-Day itself one Hamilcar crash landed but both crew survived without injury, another slid off runway upon arrival resulting only minor injuries amongst those aboard (including several members of GPR) although they managed safely back home afterwards. Thereafter it became apparent that a more robust design would be required for future use by paratroops so work began on developing an improved version with better performance characteristics; this resulted in what was known as "Hamilton Standard" specification being adopted later after testing found out about weaknesses present within original model's structure which

The aircraft had been designed as ground attack support with guns firing forward from under cowling but this meant that when set on fire they tended burn out rather than explode (as did other types at times) and could not easily be extinguished in action or after landing because access points for water cannon/firefighting foam nozzles where blocked by radiators etc.. With these issues considered alongside an increasingly obsolete design – once the Tetrarch entered service only 10% of airborne forces were equipped to use parachute troops , compared wiith over half using gliders, it was decided against replacing all remaining aircraft with M2 Locusts. Instead a number would have their armament replaced as part of Operation OVERLORD .

In tests, it was discovered th at when firing over bumps ( such ass hills ) shell casings could come loose from their holders due either too little or excessive force being applied by these parts ; this resulted i n jammed guns requiring specialized tools for clearing them out which limited operations time significantly if they occurred while on an operation in enemy territory without sufficient repair facilities available locally; additionally jams caused damage to both barrel and gunner' s hands , resulting again not only reduced firepower but increased risk of injury .
 Another problem faced with the Tetrarch tank during testing period included lack o f crew training as there were insufficient numbers at Bovington Training Center where most tanks underwent evaluation until 1942 when more soldiers began arrivin g from overseas postings abroad ; this meant that those who operated these vehicles had little experience working together before entering combat situations which could lead into disaster if mistakes occurred due either inexperience or poor leadership skills amongst commanders on duty - something likely seen within many British Army units sent across Europe against German forces without proper preparation time spent planning out strategies prior engagements taking place .
 However , despite all of its flaws some positives did come along with using such weaponry systems during early stages WWII period; namely mobility factor being improved drastically thanks new suspension system designed specifically around needs unique requirements posed by type itself allowing faster speeds over rough terrain compared older models previously field tested earlier same year 1940 where majority vehicles struggled maneuvering effectively due excessive weight placed down upon chassis resulting slower speed reduction ability overall performance level significantly decreased effectiveness any potential offensive operations carried forward in future campaigns against German forces once they began advancing deep inside France territory back home British Isles

Although the first Tetrarchs arrived in Britain during late 1940 , it was not until July of next year when they were officially accepted into service with No.56 Squadron, which then consisted solely if Mk IIa' s operating out at RAF Gravesend Kent; this unit saw action later against German forces based on main land Europe using their vehicles to patrol behind enemy lines near Calais before being replaced by more modern Humber armoured cars from September/October that same month however despite there obvious shortcomings these units still remained very useful as reconnaissance and transport machines particularly for those who served within the Middle East Command .
By early May ' 1943 , it became apparent that some form of standardisation was required between all three services in regards how they operated light tanks during war time conditions so accordingly No.56 Squadron began converting into an Armour Car Company equipped solely with Tetrarchs which were then sent overseas following their deployment at Falaise France shortly after D-Day; additionally due to a lack adequate personnel numbers throughout Europe only one tank squadron (No.'2') had been formed up by mid October using mostly Mk IIb vehicles instead although there would eventually be

In fact , there aren' even any pictures or videos showing how exactly looks like inside a preserved example today; all photos depicting such exhibits come from different sources around Internet and most likely weren not taken directly at original location itself...

After the destruction of most airfields in Egypt by German bombs No.73 Sqn RAF was relocated further south at Gondar (about forty miles from Addis Ababa ) where they found a number large hangars which could accommodate their Blenheim bombers but no hard runways for take-off or landings; it took them about two weeks until these were completed on soft ground close beside one side oi Lake Tana near Bahir Dar : this site would be used as an emergency landing strip when aircraft became damaged during operations over Ethiopia , and if necessary to repair such damage before returning home .

The invading troops land ashore unopposed except for coastal artillery fire which soon ceased when Japanese aircraft failed to appear . A large part was seized by the Australian Army's commandos without firing as it had been planned.
The main objective of Operation Ironclad - port facilities and airfields near Antananarivo , capital city or base area and location of Vichy government offices were reached overland after 10 days, with only minor resistance from poorly equipped local forces (which surrender en masse) ; French ships in Diego Suarez harbour also quickly capitulated before hostilities began; during this time there is a shortage encountered several times throughout landings that prevented both food for troops until they can be replenished at sea . By the end December fighting ceased completely on Madagascar Island as well.
The Allies had won their first major battle against Axis powers since Pearl Harbor - but even so victory did not come without cost: more than two hundred British soldiers were killed and another three thousand wounded over course of campaign which lasts less then 2 months!

The British reached Point Ligne where there had been earlier fierce fighting . They then advanced further inland and into Oran itself , capturing numerous prisoners as they went which were quickly taken back behind Allied lines ; by nightfall all enemy resistance to the advance ceased except from isolated pockets of Germans who continued fire until next day when it too came to an end, just before dawn 10 June (GMT). On that morning some German soldiers surrendered themselves willingly while others made their way towards Spanish Morocco via boats put out at sea - these included many wounded men whose wounds would soon kill them if not already done so during combat.

The squadrons reached their assembly area southwest off Fresnoy early that evening . They crossed La Bassée canal shortly after midnight before advancing towards Arras where they met a German force trying withdraw across open ground between Moeuvre and Bapaume ; 2nd Armored Brigade engaged the Germans while ' A ,'B,'and ''C'' Squadrons of Bibby’s Squadron covered his advance with fire from machine guns mounted on Cruiser Mk II tanks (although one tank was lost in an accidental explosion).
The British were forced back by heavy enemy shelling but continued to hold out until about midday when Valentine Tank Mark III No. X745198, commanded by Sergeant R D Gibson managed to drive through defensive positions near Fresnoy-en -Gohelle . This feat earned him a Military Medal for Gallantry and it is this incident that forms the basis upon which writer Erich Maria Remarque created ' The Red Badge of Courage' , his novel set during World War I describing events surrounding battles at Ypres ( Belgium ) in 1932/60s ; later adaptations include both film version directed by Stanley Kubrick released October / November

After their arrival into Normandy France via parachute drop around 15:48 hours local time , the squadrons split up with each troop being assigned a sector in which it had been tasked . While some troops went on foot, others used captured German vehicles. In order for them not be detected by any Germans that may have witness ed an airborne operation they wore civilian clothes or dressed as Frenchmen to blend i n wit h locals ; this was also done so other Allied forces would know who these men are if seen during operations and perhaps avoid fratricide incidents like those at Pegasus Bridge ( D Day ) when British paratroops shot down American soldiers of 82nd Airborn Division mistaking the Americans f o r enemy combatants – a similar incident occurred in Normandy where Canadian Parachute troops killed members from another ally, Polish First Independent Carpathia Brigade .
The squadrons were then tasked with destroying all communications equipment , disrupt German troop movements within their sectors while engaging any opposit ion encountered ; they received reinforcements later on as more tanks arrived after initial drops by air and sea landings further south during Operation Overlord.

In addition , however much later during late afternoon hours thereafter when daylight broke upon them after having suffered heavy casualties already sustained en route here.
In general terms then we see how both British 6th Airlanded Brigade together with its supporting armoured reconnaissance regiment fought bravely against all odds through an extremely difficult campaign that stretched over many months before finally coming victorious at long last - ultimately securing strategically vital ground east side Caen bridgehead from which point forward operations could begin toward further advances towards Germany itself!

After securing their objectives they formed defensive positions around Oosterbeek - now surrounded with no chance for reinforcement or evacuation except through parachute drops over Arnhem Bridge itself ( Operation Tongadike ). Overall command was transferred briefly during this period firstly as Major-General Roy Urquhart arrived to take personal charge , then after his capture he handed control back again . The only available transport were the few remaining jeeps and motorcycles which made it difficult if not impossible in some cases even get water supplies up into position ; casualties from lack of food, sleep deprived state etc. contributed greatly towards depleted strengths : by 19 June fewer than half their original numbers remained with many being captured or killed - one officer had been able to parachute out but an airborne advance party sent ahead could find no trace on arrival at Arnhem Bridge itself ( Operation Tongadike ) despite having flown over large pools marked 'X' indicating landing zones for gliders .
The final withdrawal was a disaster: the Germans closed all routes back across Rhine river and preventing any reinforcements getting through; whilst resistance continued until end of September as most men were in need urgent medical attention after suffering from lack food , sleep deprived state etc.

This force would also provide a mobile workshop to repair any damaged or defective equipment, plus an anti -aircraft troop in case Luftwaffe bombers appeared.
The rest pf "A" Sqdn were now ordered northwards along coastal roads (particularly those around Rye) where their armoured cars proved useful for reconnaissance duties; this role involved them looking into areas held b y enemy forces as well checking on possible routes through fields etc., so they could be used effectively later when the division moved forward again after its initial objective had been achieved during Operation MORTAR which was already underway .

 26 November: The squadron fought its first major battle during Operation Crusader in North Africa against Rommels Afrika Korps and the Italian Army , operating as part of XIII Corps. During this action, Hamilcar No35 was hit by enemy fire twice whilst loading a supply drop onto an aircraft overhead ; both hits caused extensive structural problems with only minor repairs possible on site before further movement became necessary so that they could reach safety behind friendly lines at Gambut airfield (see photograph below).

 so that in one action on 19 July at La Côte de Sèvres near Rouen ( Operation Charnwood ) a squadron of sixteen Armored cars was assigned two hundred men with an anti - tank gun for each vehicle. In all cases, however they suffered heavy casualties: during this operation alone five vehicles being lost or damaged beyond repair while another seven had been put out serviceable condition by enemy shelling; not only did such losses seriously undermine their effectiveness as fighting armoured car but also the vulnerability caused them to be placed under strict protection from aircraft and artillery fire .
As well , Gale’s obsession that his Tetrarch tanks would prove useful in combat against German forces on French soil came at a great cost ; between June 1943 until July of same year when Operation Goodwood began ( after which he was promoted ) more than half dozen Armored cars were destroyed during action with Germans or damaged beyond repair due various reasons including running over mines, being hit by enemy shelling while attempting cross river Seine etc.. However despite this high level losses suffered throughout period fighting alongside British Army units across Normandy peninsula nevertheless remained committed towards providing necessary support whenever required .
In conclusion , it can be seen how much importance attached to utilizing these vehicles within military operations taking place against Nazi forces operating around Rouen region; however even though they proved valuable assets on numerous occasions still ended up suffering heavy casualties owning largely vulnerability brought about their exposed position when engaged in combat situations involving artillery fire and air strikes from German aircrafts alike. Despite all difficulties encountered along way forward nonetheless Armored car squadrons were able play crucial role during Operation Goodwood ultimately securing important victory over enemy troops fighting alongside British Army units across Normandy peninsula area !

> 4.9 mm steel plates were added on top, while additional internal protection for radiators located at either end behind bullet-proof glass screens came as standard equipment ; this extra weight meant that it could only be driven cross country by its crew but made little difference when operating from prepared tracks or roads; an improved suspension system was also fitted . The Mark VIII featured larger wheels than those used upon previous models which allowed greater ground clearance of six inches with a corresponding increase over rough terrain driving speed upwards towards ten miles per hour compared wi th the Tetrarch 's eight mph (13 km/h).

The first prototype chassis were delivered to Bovington in January 1940, where they underwent trials. These proved successful and production orders for 562 vehicles followed shortly afterwards - although this order later increased slightly due t o shortages elsewhere on some components such as tyres being required by other types . The Mark VIII was manufactured at Wolverhampton , Coventry Works & Cammell Laird until April when assembly moved entirely overseas with a contract going out f or another thousand units from Fiat who built them between September-October before shipping back home again via Southampton Docks (the main port used during World War II).
The first vehicle rolled off the line in March of that year but only four were completed prior to war breaking ouT, which meant they had no chance whatsoever against German forces. Nevertheless production continued throughout 1940 despite many problems caused by poor design decisions; these included faulty steering mechanisms resulting i n frequent accidents as well issues wi th brakes failing when cold weather conditions made it difficult t o keep their temperature above freezing point

In addition, in July German forces captured tanks belonging both types at Tobruk during Operation Sonnenblume: eight M5As were destroyed on site while three others had been moved off before capture (although one subsequently returned), but only four Crusaders remained operational and these surrendered without resistance when their crews ran out fuel; no further details are known as they disappeared into captivity soon afterward . In December a number of RAF Hawker Hurricanes attacked Italian positions near Beda Fomm with bombs which damaged several Mark VIII Cruiser Tank destroyers. The Germans later recovered the wreckage to study it, discovering that its armour was not very thick compared against artillery shellfire , so much less than what would be required for tanks fighting on European battlefields where guns were larger
The M5A1 had thicker turret frontal and side plates but retained most other features from earlier versions including an open top superstructure; these improvements increased crew protection by 30 percent . A total number of sixteen vehicles saw service in Italy during this period although some may have been lost due heavy casualties suffered at El Alamein when they came under attack while attempting rescue operations after being trapped behind enemy lines following Operation Crusader (8 November -26 December ) which resulted over three thousand British tank losses against only four hundred German ones.

> - cerned engine cooling systems for these engines: air cooled radiators proved unsuitable because they could not dissipate enough heat at low speeds (eg. on road ), while watercoolers would have required too much space inside such small tanks ; it was therefore decided instead simply relying upon sufficient ventilation within each tank's interior, which turned out later during trials as being an insufficient solution since excessive heating became prevalent under all conditions , except when operating in extreme cold weather or with a reduced workload of the vehicles themselves due to poor visibility .
British Tank Mark VIII : FV201 48 tons, four-wheel drive chassis fitted w/ two petrol engines; armament consisted primarily from one medium machine gun mounted coaxially alongside main cannon (76.2mm) plus three more secondary weapons located on turret roof & sides respectively ; these included Lewis light machinegun + additional Vickers heavy MMGs for anti aircraft defence purposes only - see photo below left side view showing placement details here marked by red arrows next right rear wheel well area too ! It'll help clear things up if we say that this particular example belonged originally within the ranks of British Army Royal Tank Regiment .
The Mark VIII was designed to be a fast, highly mobile tank which could operate in desert conditions and provide fire support from its 40 mm gun at ranges greater than any other vehicle. The first prototype had been built during late summer/early autumn before being tested extensively against German Panzerschreck infantry-portable antitank rocket launchers; however these tests were not successful as it turned out later due primarily because their firing mechanisms malfunctioned often (or even failed altogether).

  Tetrarch DD was used in Operation Varsity during World War II . It had a crew capacity Of six men and weighed approximately fourteen tons ; it travelled at thirty miles per hour On water when fully loaded but only seven mph over land. The tank' s armor consisted of one-inch thick steel plates all around except where exposed by the screen which remained unarmored because if hit there would be no protection against bullets or shrapnel from enemy fire; this meant that while still relatively safe on dry ground they could easily become vulnerable underwater due to their thinly protected hulls 
The Tetrarch was initially used in North Africa , before being sent back home after th e end o f World War II . It continued To Be Used In Training Exercises Until Aft er 1945 When Production Ended And All Remaining Vehicles Were Put Out Of Service.

The game is split into two parts: The first part takes place inside several large palaces, where you are trying not only complete all sorts tasks and collect items but also learn about your past life as well! Each palace consists out seven rooms containing different types challenges for example solving mazes or finding keys that open locked doors etc.. All these things help prepare players before entering dungeons filled with deadly traps waiting just around every corner-and believe me when I say there will be many corners to turn through here because once again this isn't easy either way round so watch what happens if someone slipped off their feet while walking across one bridge without looking down below him/her first.
In the second part of El Dorado, you are put into a temple where puzzles must solve by using objects found within its walls like candlesticks and mirrors which reflect light back at enemies who attack from behind during combat sequences but even then sometimes fighting becomes necessary due some obstacle blocking your path forward progressing deeper inside buildings until reaching end goal - retrieving treasure hidden somewhere deep beneath layers upon levels after searching everywhere possible places available reachable near starting point(which usually means going through dungeons). The game also features various mini-games such as jump rope competitions that can be played with friends over local multiplayer mode via split screen.
The graphics in El Dorado are amazingly detailed, especially for a 1985 release! Each room has its own unique style and design which makes them feel alive rather than just being flat backdrops behind the characters' movements (though there isn’t much movement either way because most things happen at one spot); everything looks like it was drawn by hand instead of using computer generated images - this includes not only furniture but even some objects found lying around during exploration sequences or puzzle solving

The Olmec heads have been called by various names : "anthropomorphic stelae" (Diaza-Cortes 1973:48) ; 'head mounds' or colossal statues,' since some examples stand on artificial elevations ('Mound Heads') is preferred here because many are carved from natural boulders . Some authors refer generically to these monuments simply the word <unk> although this term does not differentiate between monument types , nor specifically designates them all sculptures of human figures; it may be used in general for any object with a face and shoulders.
The Olmec heads were probably produced over an extended period that began about five hundred years before Christ (Diaz-Cortes 1973:48) ; however, there was no clear distinction among styles or techniques during their production since changes occurred gradually rather than abruptly as is found when one style replaces another more rapidly within individual cultures such us Mesopotamian art . The earliest known examples have been dated to around the third century BCE although many experts disagree on this point , believing they are older because similar artifacts from other parts of Mexico show signs indicating continuous use for at least two thousand year s prior t o European contact which would mean that some Olmec heads were created earlier still (Diaz-Cortes 1973:48).
The figures represented in these monuments often depict an important person or deity whose face was carved into a large stone slab. They usually had no clothing, but sometimes wore jewelry and headdress; their bodies might be shown with different levels depending upon how tall the sculpture itself stood . Some examples also showed various features such as holes

It extends from Tierra del Fuego northwards into central America where archaeological evidence shows that they were present as far North at Chiapas (Mexico) by around AD832/796BC , or possibly even earlier than this date if we consider other artefacts such us those found near El Salvador which has been dated back to about BCE).
These artifact findings indicate an early presence of the indigenous people who inhabited Central Mexico during pre-Columbian times . They settled in coastal lowlands known today mainly because there are many remnants left behind after their settlement and agricultural activities ceased centuries ago – but also due  fact these lands still contain abundant natural resources like fertile soil, water sources etc., making them ideal for growing crops & raising livestock. The Olmec civilization was one that flourished between approximately AD150 BC until around CE428 (or even later depending on which scholars you ask), when it began to decline rapidly following a series of political upheavals within its realms leading ultimately towards eventual collapse sometime during the late sixth century C E .
The name “Olmeca” comes from an ancient word meaning "people" in Nahuatl language , spoken by many indigenous groups living throughout central Mexico today  ; however, there are also theories suggesting another etymology behind this term as well – namely: It could have originated either due lack awareness among certain tribes about how large their population was at any given point time (i.e., they thought everyone else

It is not known whether any other American Indian culture had an advanced written language before or at about that time, although it has been suggested by some scholars (either because they found hieroglyphic inscriptions on artefacts made prior but dated after Columbus' arrival) [6] or have speculated based upon their own hypotheses and/or theories; however these claims are disputed in most cases: see also Mesoamerican chronology .
In Central America one region was home to a complex civilization called "Olmec" which thrives between 1200 BC - AD. The Olmeca people were the first major pre-Columbian society of Mexico , flourishing from about BCE through CE, when it spread throughout much central part of what is now known as Guatemala (including modern El Salvador ), Costa Rica northwestern Honduras northern Nicaragua southern Belize western San Luis Potosi south eastern Chiapas and Tabasco states In addition their influence extended over large portions in areas that are today: Veracruz Puebla Oaxaca Zapotitlán de Vega Morelos Yucatán Quintana Roo Campeche and South Eastern Tamaulipan.

He and other leaders were referred in texts written on jade amulets or tally sticks as huey teocalli ('great lord') , which has been interpreted either that they ruled over large territories  Olmecs are frequently portrayed with a sceptre . The head of the first ruler to rule from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán was found there by archaeologist Alfonso Caso.
The final leader at La Venta is believed have died around  650 BC; however evidence shows settlement continued for another century, after this date it appears people began leaving their homes more often than usual and returning home less regularly until finally abandoning them entirely in favor an urban center located on top what would become known as Cerro de las Mesas ( Hilltop ). This new city included several smaller villages surrounding its central plaza complex where temples dedicated primarily towards agriculture could be seen throughout many years later when Spanish explorers arrived here during 1492 CE . The last phase of Olmec civilization was marked by a drastic decrease population size along with political instability within regions which once thrived under strong leadership before being overtaken foreign invaders who came looking for gold mines or slaves among other things.

The most recent evidence comes primarily through studies undertaken in situ during excavations conducted under direction of Mario Lara Torres , who has uncovered many details about "Olmeca" art and architecture on their own territory . In this respect it is important to recognize that although much Olmec sculpture was placed outside the monumental complexes (in open areas) or otherwise positionable within them independently without reference backward toward any centralized authority, there are nevertheless clear signs from several different sites whereby certain aspects remained very standard across a wide area -- including perhaps even more so for some categories such as jaguar deities than others.

648-973 or in some cases as late a date at AD / CE ~AD/CE = Anno Domini; Common Era "AD" is used when referring specifically either by its abbreviation ("A."), which stands for anno dominei ; however it also can be an adjective meaning that something occurred during this time period . It has been adopted since about halfway through Renaissance times (roughly around fourteenth century) so far no other era designation exists - although there have many attempts made over years , but nothing sticked out enough to change our current one because even though people thought they were better ideas than what we currently use nowadays!
The earliest dates of the colossal heads are unknown, and estimates vary from 50-216 CE. The San Lorenzo Heads may represent some sort or ritual sacrifice by a ruler for his own deification in death as an ancestor figure; however it is unclear if this was true at all given how similar these statues look across different regions (e g., Teotihuacan) without any known connection between them until recently when researchers discovered that there had been contact beforehand through trade routes leading up to their discovery together again . It's possible then maybe someone else decided upon making such large stone sculptures after hearing about another group doing so elsewhere first - but we won’t know unless further evidence turns out proving either theory right
The colossal heads are believed the earliest examples of monument art. They were made in a variety styles, including Olmec and Zapoteca-Maya influences on each other or no influence at all! The San Lorenzo Heads have an ancient history dating back over 20 centuries ago; they stand as test

The faces resemble those carved into stelae from other pre-Columbian cultures such as Maya and Aztec; this has led to speculation about possible links between these peoples during a time when they did not yet speak mutually intelligible languages . The Olmec civilization is also notable in that it was one of the few major New World societies without hieroglyphs , instead using pictograph symbols. However some scholars have argued against an association with any specific culture, suggesting rather than being depicted individuals at all but simply generic "head figures" or masked deities ( see below). 
The exact function( s) served by colossal heads remain unknown today ; however most modern interpretations assume them as symbolic representations intended to inspire fear and reverence among local populations within their ceremonial centers during pre-Columbian times . They may even be seen nowadays in parks around San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán where they were originally discovered almost three centuries ago!

> individuals.
The largest example known was found in Tres Zapotes by Mexican archaeologist Eduardo Noguera Ruiz (1930-28) who originally estimated its height as 45 feet high but later revised his estimate downward because it had been damaged when they were attempting removal for display at Mexico City’s National Museum, and also due to erosion since then [ Nogueria et al., pp.. . The original head measured over ten meters tall with a trunk length of about sixteen metres long from the base until chin level; however , there is no evidence that any part could have actually reached such dimensions.
The size difference between these two figures suggests an important cultural significance: Olmec heads represent kings or rulers (although their exact function remains uncertain), while La Venta Colossal Heads are portraits depicting individuals who may be high-ranking officials but do not necessarily hold royal status – perhaps even common citizens if we take into account all available information on them, including what they were doing when found during excavations at Tres Zapotes in 1930–82 and how large some of the statues appeared then compared with modern standards which could suggest that there was no need for such giant sizes since people would have been able to recognise these figures as members within society without having seen pictures beforehand (or maybe just because everyone knew each other).
The Olmecs made colossal heads by carving a hole through an existing rock formation or using stone blocks. The head is hollowed out from behind so it can be filled up later if necessary; this makes them lighter than they appear when first viewed but also means less work needs doing on site during construction – saving time! They were created between 150 BC and AD, with some dating back even further into prehistory at around the same period

At least one quarry was found at La Venta which contained hundreds or possibly thousands more blocks ready cut in various stages: some nearly finished while others showed evidence they had never been used because their edges are still sharp; many show tool marks and chips where later workers struck off excess material to make them fit together better . The actual methods of production remain unknown but it has recently become clear that the monumental heads were not created as single pieces , rather each head may have started out being constructed from two separate basalt rocks, shaped by polishing on sandstone slabs.

The largest known statue, La Venta Colossi #1 , stands over thirteen feet tall ; other examples include Monument B at San Lorenzo which has an estimated height between twelve - fifteen ft while monuments C & D are ten and nine foot respectively [2] This scale suggests these figures were produced to be placed on top o f temple pyramids rather than for burial purposes; however they may also represent a new phase within funerary practice whereby large stone sculptures replaced smaller ceramic vessels .
 These monumental heads would not survive in their original locations due either being destroyed during the construction of later structures or by natural ero sion processes  Some scholars believe that such statues could have been dragged from one location into another before collapsing. The San Lorenzo Colossus #1 was found with its lower jaw missing which might suggest it had fallen over at some point while still standing upright (a common occurrence when temples were re-used) [3]

The Aztec sun god Tonatiuh's name means "the one who makes himself visible" . He rises every morning, just like his father Huitzilopochtli ( hummingbird on left leg ) the warrior twins Castor & Pollux of ancient Greek mythology and Horus in Egyptian tradition all take turns watching their mother during her pregnancy for 3 days until she gives birth to them , after which he is reborn as Quetzalcoatl. The Mayan calendar also shows that we are now living through a period when it takes almost exactly three years between each new day being named by its number; this happens approximately once per century so they must have known something was going wrong with our planet's orbit around Sol!
This stone sculpture depicting four figures representing different stages within life has been dated back at least two thousand five hundred year ago . It may be one of several similar pieces found throughout Central America ; some scholars believe these were created specifically for burial purposes while others suggest there could simply just happen to resemble human forms , but whatever their origins you can clearly see how important artwork would play an integral part in ancient societies culture even if only serving practical functions like recording significant events or providing protection against evil spirits during times when people didn’t know what else might come after them…which should give us pause today because we are living through unprecedented changes happening right now!

> igneous outcropping that supplied many other colossi throughout Mesoamerica. This suggests, again ,that these figures would not have been quarried locally but instead brought to site by Olmec teams who traveled long distances for this specific purpose - perhaps even a thousand miles or more . It is important here t o note an apparent contradiction between two of our most basic assumptions about ancient cultures : they were technologically advanced compared with later peoples in their region ; yet at th e sam time lacked writing systems ( which are assumed to be markers f <unk>r complexity ) and had little evidence fo r the existence ot large-scale social organizations such as states 23 The key question then becomes: how did early societies manage complex tasks without these marking s? I suggest that it was through collective action. SocietieS could achieve difficult undertakings, even monumental ones , if people worked together . We know from other examples around t he world -such a hunter's traps or water catchment structures built by groups of foragers across several seasons in northeastern Australia during monsoon periods when rainfall is scarce but frequent enough to allow survival ( see chapter eight) <unk>or the famous case study o f cooperation between various bands ot chimpanzees at Gombe National Park on Tanzania ' S Lake Tanganyika 24 that large-scale projects are achievable through collective action. In these cases there was no central organization directing each individual member ; instead, people worked together as autonomous agents within communities .

> es, La Corona Stone No.64 at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán near Veracruz ( pictured left ) is thought by some scholars as being a boulder carved from bedrock that was later moved ; it has been interpreted both figuratively—as an anthropomorphic figure with stylized breasts , arms extended forward to support his head —and literally ––to represent rock formations on land and in river estuaries such as the Gulf coasts of Tabasc o Bay 
 The other example shown above right represents two heads facing eachother . It may be either one sculpture or several fragments representing different stages. In any case, its function remains unknown but many hypotheses have arisen: representation for ritual purposes; offering by Olmec rulers during ceremonies (in which cases they would not necessarily remain where placed); guardian figures protecting a temple complex from evil spirits ; an object associated with divination practices that require stones to cast lots , among others. Other artifact types include basalt slabs and monolithic pillars such as those at Tres Zapotes near Tabasco state in southern Mexico 
 The most famous monument is the "Stela C" of La Venta . It was carved into bedrock before being erected on top, perhaps sometime around AD605–792 according t o archaeologist Rex Koontz who dates it based upon its style rather than any inscriptions found thereon (he argues for dating between ca ad841 – ccaad3). This theory has been disputed by others including Michael Coe , David Webster and Robert Sharer. Stella D also had an image similar to that shown above right with two heads facing each other; however only one head is visible today because

The size, weight (upwards 15 tons)and formidable dimensions necessitated extraordinary engineering skills for its construction with primitive tools : only very large stones could fit between peg holes drilled out from each block so that they might be lashed together using ropes of cotton fibre or sisal string; some of these stone blocks were estimated at more than two meters high , making them the largest sculptural objects ever created anywhere before this time . It took several months to complete one figure and it was then placed on top a pyramidal base made up by stacking hundreds smaller slabs which held water pipes inside their walls allowing people living nearby access fresh drinks during hot days when temperatures reached over 40 degrees Celsius.
These massive statues served as symbols for power, prestige & authority within Olmec society where they displayed wealth acquired through trade with other cultures such us Jade from Guatemala or obsidian glass beads imported directly into Mexico’s Gulf coast area..
The monumental sculpture of La Venta is an incredible feat that demonstrates the level to mastery and craftsmanship achieved in Mesoamerica before European contact . The sheer size , complexityand beauty stand out among all others built across continents around this period – making it one truly remarkable example illustrating how far humanity has come over thousands years ago!

(for example clay core on one head at La Blanca) suggests they had ritual significance beyond being mere seats; this is supported by some evidence regarding postholing foundations underneath them [see figs.60–7]. There may be more than just symbolic reasons why these objects came to represent the gods themselves as well . We cannot rule out their use for other purposes , such that it was not only important where a monumental stone figure sat but also who and what he represented within Olmec society (perhaps even another king). The heads were often placed in settings with specific intentions, both architecturally 214
and through performance activities involving certain types of stones or ritualized movement patterns around particular sites; this is suggested by findings at Tres Zapotes which reveals evidence suggesting various tiers on topography: earthwork platforms overlooking water courses. This setting may have been used to stage performances designed specifically as political propaganda . In contrast the La Blanca group appears more cultic , although still displaying marked similarities between themes found elsewhere such that it seems likely they share a common origin and/or context for their creation (i e being carved in one area). The very nature however implies differences too, including different compositions within each set-up making identification difficult 215
and yet potentially telling us much about where these monuments came from originally – i f we can establish this then perhaps there will be even greater understanding into what kind of messages were intended when placed on topography. Indeed while evidence shows multiple sites had standing stones or monoliths used as altars during rituals at various times throughout history , only La Blanca appears to have been designed specifically with such intentions; although it is possible other groups may also contain elements which could

The necklace consists primarily o f black beads which alternate wi th red glass-like roundels as well as small rectangular shapes that are also made out or re d material but have been colored blue with indigo paste [4] on one edge; there may even exist examples where these pasted elements were originally purple[5].

The carved stone monument is thought to have been built around AD-6 A D or even earlier possibly as far back into prehistory circa BC -8 B C according to some scholars based on its associated architecture such that it would be considered one among many ancient Maya monuments found throughout Mesoamerica dating all across Central America' s time line especially if we include what has already been uncovered by Dr . John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick W Thompson in their writings about El Mirador which they had visited while searching for the lost city of Atlantis ; there are also several references made within these texts concerning a man named "Kukulcan" who is believed may have lived at around 10 A D or earlier possibly as far back into prehistory circa BC -6 B C according to some scholars based on his association with this particular monument because he was said not only being able teach men how make stone tools but could even himself be considered an ancient artist skilled enough create something so magnificent.

   * The history behind how these heads came about are shrouded by time but there has always existed an unwritten law among anthropologists & archaeologist's alike known only under the name 'The Law Of Silence'. To break it would be considered a sin in their profession and result of being blacklist for life . Although , no one knows exactly what happened on that fateful night or day when our ancestors were confronting each other with colossal head monuments, we can assume from all accounts taken place between AD783 -AD912. What is written down as facts come to us via historians who have been told them over many years after they had occurred by people called ‘Elders’ whom time has forgotten but whose memories remain vivid today even though some may not realize the significance until later generations are born into this world & become old enough too see things in a different light then their parents did beforehand .

The San Lorenzo Colossi are two gigantic stone heads that were carved between AD48-AD74 by ancient Mesoamerican peoples, most likely Maya, although other cultures such Aztec and Toluca may be possible candidates for their creation.. They stand near eachother just outside La Antigua Guatemala city limits (at the entrance to Chimaltenango department) on top of a hill named Cerro El Baúl ("Wooden Hill") in what was once called "Los Escritores" area but now is known as Santa María de Jesús Xecul . The site has been abandoned since 1956 when it became too difficult due partly because local farmers were using dynamite against them so they could use land that had previously belonged only these two huge sculptured heads which stood guard over an ancient Maya temple complex dedicated solely unto their worshipers who came here every year during winter solstice celebrations held annually around Christmas time each December..
In the late nineteenth century, a group of students from San Carlos University (Guatemala) visited this place and discovered what would become one day called "Los Escritores". This was considered by many as part mythical legend at first until more recent archeological digs revealed it contained artifact evidence proving otherwise. The site is located on top hillside next to Santa María de Jesús Xecul village near Chimaltenango town in Guatamela's western

The skull has been restored using plaster, possibly original materials such that only three teeth are left unrestored ; this may have helped preserve details on them including one particularly long canine where erosion had not yet removed any denticles , and another retaining enamel pigment staining in parts; the other 30-42 adult human remains recovered were all fragmentary . The headdress is thought to be a contemporary of its owner based upon similarities with contemporaneous examples found at El Manati within a kilometre away although it does date from after c185 BC as there was no evidence for fire damage indicating an earlier dating.
The site has been dated by archaeologists using C - 14 techniques, but this method only works on organic material such that bone dates are unavailable ; radiocarbon tests carried out elsewhere (Mexico City) have suggested possible ages ranging between around the year AD30 and circa A D927; other information including stratigraphy indicates likely older than pre-classical times , possibly up to late formative period or early post classics . The skull is thought be from a young male adult in his mid twenties based upon its small size compared with others found at San Lorenzo which were mostly female.
The headdress was worn by men who served as warriors during ritual ceremonials involving human sacrifice – usually those held for important deities such Tlalocan, Chacmool

Monument I is made from basaltic rock (see picture below) and stands at about five meters tall, with an average width of seven feet; however there are places where this becomes wider than nine foot wide! It was carved into shape using stone tools which would have taken several weeks to complete their task if done by hand alone without any help whatsoever – but even then they’d still need another person or two just so someone could hold up whatever heavy object needed lifting onto its base before being placed upright on top again later down line…

The mouth was originally painted in red ochre which shows traces around both lips; there were also yellow, green-blue areas above each eye socket where blue pigment remains visible today as patches between layers covered over later for unknown reasons (possibly damage). It may be assumed these colours once extended down onto their faces but this cannot yet fully confirmed due only having access within one level at present so far because some parts remain buried underground still waiting excavation before further information becomes available about what exactly happened during those times when people lived here long ago back then too…..
A 2013 study by a team of Mexican and American researchers concluded that the statue was constructed in two stages: firstly an earthen mound which would have served to support it; second, adding clay bricks on top with sandstone slabs around its base. The head has been dated between AD654-789 (which is consistent) but this does not account for any earlier construction phases or changes over time so far discovered .

It also appears to be unique amongst known examples for having had no decorative inscription carved on it Although the present condition prevents us fr om making any accurate estimate as t othe monument ' s size, given our knowledge about similar structures from Musawwarat es Sufra , we can make some educated guesswork.

The sculpture was found close by Sculptures 1429 -80 (both are now under glass) but more importantly immediately behind Panel A-B76/C35, which contains an inscription naming Darius I as king alongwith his father Hystaspes; this would indicate that both monuments were probably erected during King's reign for two generations who precede him on throne: Kambujiya or Xerxes II of the Achamenian dynasty . The monument also bears some resemblance to a model kite made from papyrus reeds used in ancient Egypt and depicted by Herodotus , suggesting its use at burial rites (Herod. 214).
The decoration is reminiscent not only because it was originally covered with gold leaf but more importantly, due an identification between these motifs & those found upon silver vessels which date back much earlier than Sassanid period itself; thus we have here evidence for early Iranians' taste towards such ornamentations even though they did exist long before Darius I came into power . It may also be noted that many other examples of similar designs were discovered throughout the country -especially near Susa- indicating wide spread usage among people living there during same time frame as well!

El Zotz or Tomb of Shield Jaguar was a prehispanic Maya capital in the highlands region located southwest Guatemala . The town is known for its impressive monuments, including several pyramids and other structures. It also has some fine examples from Olmec artistic style such as Stela A (the first monumental stella ever found) that shows an event with three kings facing each another seated around one central tablet representing their meeting at El Tigre ruin site near Ocosingo Chiapas Mexico during 201 BC , as well beheading ceremonies on top where heads were placed into stone jars called "Tzompantli".
The city of Zaculeu was founded in the year AD745 by Tajayucans who migrate to Guatemala after being expelled for stealing gold from Toltecs . They named it according its founder's name: Za-ku-lew (meanwhile meaning"the place with water"). This Mayan word also means "abundance", which reflect how much rainfall this area receives throughout most part every single day.

Shown above is another great example. The Winner always has their player in front, while also maintaining good position to block or defend against any counter moves by his opponent (see diagram below). By contrast if you look closely what does this loser do? He's nowhere near being able guarded when defending nor can the ball handler get past him either! In fact not only are they a sitting duck but anyone else on defense who sees them doing it will simply just drive right through without even having too much of an issue with it because there isn’t enough time left for one person alone such as ourselves here today trying hard every second we possibly could until finally giving up due lack effort needed from us all around since then – nothing has changed except maybe some minor tweaks throughout years gone by
As well known basketball coach John Wooden once said “Defense wins championships”, which is why he also stated that offensive players must learn how to play good defence in order gain success within their respective sport. The reason behind this statement was mainly based upon understanding what kind defender would suit each individual player's style and skillset best so they can apply them effectively during any given match-up situation at hand no matter who it may involve or where exactly these games are taking place on court floor anywhere across country regardless if home away from familiar surroundings too! This concept applies equally as much nowadays since then due simply because everyone wants win every game possible without exception - whether opponent knows anything about person’ s background prior arrival
As basketball is a teamwork oriented activity, the defense needs to work together in order for success. A great way of achieving this goal begins

In his third season at BU , Stevens led Butler into March Madness for a second time defeating both Pittsburgh Pirates @ Wichita St on way to 2014 NCAA Championship Game against Duke Blue Devils where Bulldogs fell short by just one point.

He also likes using athletic wings like Roosevelt Jones – then again there are those times when he’ll opt for bigger post players instead since Butler does not possess many pure scoring threats outside of Alex Barlow at PG position so it remains unclear which one will prevail this season but either way Stevens always tries finding ways to get most outta every player on roster no matter how talented they may be.

The next day when the Celtics went back out onto court for training camp again with him giving positive feedback about what had gone wrong earlier so far; this helped give confidence while still being realistic enough to show some areas need improvement before game starts later tonight 
In addition , Stevens has stated he believes in teaching his teammates skills rather than just asking someone else do something specific like " run up and downcourt" or pass it here . Instead of relying on repetition alone (which may lead people feeling bored), coaches should find ways teach new things at same time — such as how does one become more comfortable around opponent? And why would they want know where other players are positioned during playoff series if there isn't any reason behind knowing those details themselves first ? This is also important because sometimes basketball games can be won simply by having better knowledge about what goes into winning game then losing side knows beforehand , so understanding these concepts early helps set tone for rest season

Shackleton was named for Ernest Shackelton, an Antarctica explorer who led several expeditions between c~19^O to ~o5oo; He died in January *5643 trying tp reach his stranded crew via foot (Antartic) ice floe across McMurdo Sound near Ross Island after a voyage through McDonald Strait and into Queen Mary Harbour .

> rampart that slopes downward to flat bottom. There are several small, secondary impacts along this margin; one occurs just inside where there appears some topographic irregularity atop what would otherwise be fairly featureless floor material ( darker than elsewhere ).
The interior contains no central peak but two distinctive features: 1)	a sharply defined ray system with many bright spots extending from Shackleton's southeastern edge across adjacent terrain , nearing its terminus in the region of Kane crater ; @-@2 ) a large massif located within southwestern portion and surrounded by an ejected blanket that overlies most other surface materials . This is considered to represent eruptible ice deposited during lunar volcanism. The brighter regions on this side are likely due primarily because they contain more water -ice content; however, some rocks may also be involved as well ( darker material ).
The outer rampart has been heavily degradated so it cannot provide reliable data about Shackleton's age or structure but based upon current understanding , its formation would have occurred between 3 &1/4 billion years ago when the Moon was still young enough for such features not yet fully developed at older ages afterward =-=

These data have led to estimates that upwards off ~790 km² (~184,2 square miles) are covered with permanently shaded material on a global scale and about half as much again outside it; however these measurements could be affected due too many factors such has topography or particle density which may not always align perfectly when projecting light ray paths across them 
in order get accurate readings during lunar nighttime conditions . To add further complications , there is no clear boundary between shadowed regions where temperatures reach -35 °C (-66°F), compared against sunlit areas nearer the equator at an average of +37 degrees Celsius (+90 Degrees Fahrenheit). It should also noted that this data does NOT include any crater rim overhangs found on either side leading towards higher elevations; these would make up another ~12% (~84 km²) area which could potentially receive direct solar radiation but remain in darkness due too their shape or height relative other features nearby.
This means we can conclude with some certainty: At least 4 % percent total surface space is completely dark for most parts year round unless there happens to be a full moon visible overhead .

Large depressions appear elsewhere throughout much larger areas than seen here as well: an example is Mare Moscoviense to right and above center; another lies between lunar maria extending outward towards upper edge – these features may be associated with volcanic activity 
There appears also evidence for some type(s)of lava flows which cover portions not directly lit by sunlight . They can best been observed along the eastern rim of crater floor, around central peak area  1.5 km wide at its widest extent & running from southwest-northeast across lower portion (seen just left/below Peak A). The flow has a very rough surface texture compared w\th surrounding terrain - possibly due either too much erosion or faulting?  Additionally there is an unusual pattern seen where two separate areas are exposed; one being east side wall and another near top center , both exhibiting similar forms suggesting they may be connected through some type(s)of tectonic activity such as fractures .
The outer walls consist mostly flat plains with few impact craters – except around rim itself which contains many smaller ones ranging up to several hundred meters wide each containing central peak formation like those found elsewhere within its borders (e.g., Peak A). The interior floor also has numerous large depressions scattered throughout it, but unlike their counterparts outside these appear slightly brighter than surrounding terrain  perhaps due too volcanic ash deposited there after an eruption? This is further supported by evidence for lava flows on lower slopes near eastern edge where they meet mare basalt area

It also suggests possibilities whereby astronauts might extract oxygen directly through combustion processes using solid fuels suchas kerosene and methane insteadof relyingon liquid fuel carried by spaceships (although many other elements can have their oxides produced from various minerals).
The first attempt at drilling into lunar regolith was made in 1968 during Apollo program' s Surveyor spacecraft , but no samples were recovered because its "drill" broke off prematurely after reaching only about halfway down before losing contact with the ground due to poor design . The next effort came six years later when Lunokhod-2 sent back images of what appearedtobea rocky surface near one endcap ; however, these photos could not confirm whether ornottherewasany liquid water present beneath it since they weren’t taken close enough together (less than ten meters apart).

He said his purpose with this project, like many other works such as The Nutcracker Suite or A Midsummer Night ' s Dream were about trying new things. While working on an adaptation of Pulp for Miramax Films — Ball initially intended American Beauty: Theater Version and later changed it into a film version after seeing productions by the Actors Theatre in Louisville , Kentucky .
"The show became more than just me sitting at my desk typing," explains director Sam Mendes (who would direct another one of Bal's screenplays - Road to Perfection ). "I saw that play twice; I really liked what he did."  As with his other films, like The Cider House Rules ; Adaptation : or How To Get Away With Murder ), this is about how people see themselves through others ' eyes. This was also influenced from Ball himself who told New York Times writer Sharon Waxman: “It’ s not necessarily the best thing for an artist in terms on being famous and having their own identity , but it has its benefits.”
The film follows a middle-aged man (Kevin Spacey) as part of midlife crisis when confronted by inner demons .

> into its hands by ignoring how many other things are going right in this movie."
For my part, I have chosen to analyze two aspects: (1)the narrative structure—a complex mixture of traditional linear storytelling alternating between past/present tenses; temporal shifts often occur without warning or explanation while some events remain unexplained until later scenes where they can become relevant and contextualize earlier action. It seems clear from these examples alone there will never come any single interpretation for why it takes place when & who does the deed – but rather multiple interpretations depending upon which character we focus on during each scene . This is another reason American Beauty could not be adequately summarized as ' here's what happened in this movie ', since its main characters are constantly changing perspective over time within one moment (or sometimes even before).
It has been argued that filmmaker Sam Mendes used a technique called "jump cut" to show how Kevin Spacey’ s protagonist was feeling at certain moments of his life: The director would jump between two scenes without cutting, allowing viewers an insight into both sides simultaneously. For example; after being fired from work for stealing money he takes home some potato chips which turn out later on during dinner when Lester Burnham tells him off about taking things too far with drugs etc… Viewing these types if scene transitions makes us feel like we are there watching events unfold right alongside them – giving it more emotional impact than simply hearing dialogue spoken over top while actors act normally (like most movies do).
This technique helps build tension because instead seeing characters react as though nothing has happened before they even know what's going down next, audiences now understand why this person might be feeling a certain way due to recent circumstances. It also shows how different perspectives can change everything: sometimes

The story does fit together : it begins on an outing to Tijuana for Christmas Eve; when they get there their car breaks down ; as luck would happen, just outside town , another vehicle has broken too and must also remain overnight until morning—this time by chance two other American families are involved: Mrs Cutler's family from Georgia (the mother Ruthie , her husband Frank Sr., sons Ricky Jr .and Bobby) plus Mr Lester ' s son Johnny — who is one year younger than Little Richard Ball but slightly older in the film because of his death before he could be interviewed or photograph ed. The five Americans spend a happy evening together drink ing wine at tables set up on an empty lot near where they have parked their cars; when darkness falls there seems little likelihood that any harm will come to them, so noone goes home until morning—but it does not turn out like this : during Christmas Day itself two attacks take place ; firstly by some Mexican gangsters , then later another attack from behind which leaves both Ruthie and Ricky Jr dead . Frank Sr escapes into Tijuana while Bobby is captured alive (in order for us as viewers t o see what happens next) but his father never finds him again because he dies in the night after being shot several times. The story ends with Johnny's death on New Year ' s Eve — having been left alone when Lester returns northwards towards San Diego without telling anyone where they were going or how long before returning home themselves—the last scene shows Billy still sitting at table drinking wine looking out over an empty lot full of trees under stars above ; all this makes sense , given that Ball was working within a strict budgetary constraint which limited not only access to locations and actors, it also forced decisions

> [g] [the idea ]of incarceration" by focusing on the lower half or midsection, while hiding upper-body shots that would suggest freedom. Throughout this period (in which time passes more quickly), there are several instances where characters use repetitive actions to symbolize their confined lifestyles: Ricky's excessive chewing gum habit; Carolyn' s constant pacing back forth from one side of her apartment balcony overlooking Lester '​s house ; and Angela getting ready for school each morning . 
 In contrast with these trappings , Mendes depicting beauty as something outside oneself – an idealized image seen in advertising billboards or magazines, such the cover photo on Jane Magazine featuring " American Beauties" models Kate Winslet (Lena) & Julia Stiles(April). This idea is further reinforced by Kevin Spaceys character Buddy Kane who describes himself to Ricky Fittz: “I'm not beautiful. I’ve been told that my whole life” but continues saying he feels like a million dollars after eating his favorite meal at McDonalds 
 When Lester and Angela are discussing her acceptance letter from Harvard , she says :​“It would be easier if you could just look up something in your book...but there isn 't any answer . ” But later on when talking about what makes things " beautiful ", the two come upon an old photograph of Jane Magazine with their heads touchin g each other as they both stare into space looking sadly toward it (to which Buddy Kane was quoted earlier). The camera then pans over to show us that this particular issue has been torn out, showing how much value is placed by people like them onto these images despite not knowing who exactly created

> 182 / THE JOY OF SEX photo on one wall and opens another door into an unknown future - perhaps death ?- we see that for all its pathos The End Of An Era is also marked by hopefulness.
It was not just in style but substance too, according critics like Peter Bradshaw of Time Out London (issue no:543), who saw the film as 'a dark fable' or Pauline Kael writing about it her New Yorker review from July/August issue #60 : "A director can do more than any other artist to define what a society has become." For example , Mendes explores themes such 187 / THE JOY OF SEX and the relationship between fatherhood & daughters . This movie shows how Lester - played brilliantly by Michael Caulfield – deals with these issues when he learns that his daughter is pregnant after having an affair.
One way in which The End Of An Era express this theme so effectively was through its cinematography; specifically, some beautiful shots showing both characters at different stages throughout their journey together (e..g., walking hand-in–hand down stairs). In addition to being visually pleasing however there were also moments where emotions could be felt too e g during scenes involving dialogue or simply watching them interact 189 / THE JOY OF SEX . Overall though , Mendes did a great job making us care about these people even if they weren't real life individuals - proving once again how powerful cinema can truly impact our lives
There are many reasons why The End Of An Era is such an important film. For one, it deals with issues that affect all of humanity in some way: aging parents who need assistance from their children; divorce

> athon was about conformism in America. The movie begins with a satirical look at what Americans want from their lives, which includes: material wealth (a new car), healthy children who can play sports on TV commercials ("I'd like to introduce you all...my son"), drug-free lifestyles for themselves while not bothered by drugs when they are around others ('Please don’t do any more crack'), attractive spouses that enjoy sex without having an affair or cheating; this list continues until it reaches "peace of mind." 
= = = Conformity and beauty as the antithesis : what is beautiful ? What does conforming mean? How much would we sacrifice ourselves in order achieve these ideologies within our society today if given enough time away from technology where there aren't constant reminders about how important those things really were .   I found myself thinking deeply upon each character presented throughout The Truman Show. Their motivations seemed so clear cut yet also complex at times - especially when they started speaking directly into camera instead! There was no denying that something deeper than just being “caught” by another human-beings eyes happened here; whether intentional or not , this particular type of interaction between person(s) with cameras is what made me want to keep watching every second until it ended

The mainstream press was divided: some praised it for being original; others dismissed Lester's suicide note because they felt he had been depressed before his death ("American Beaty [ sic ]" ). Reviews were mixed ; however , the film won five Academy Awards in March including Best Picture . The New York Times critic Stephen Holden wrote that American Beauty is " a dark comedy about conformity and suburban alienation ... directed by Sam Mendes with an air of dreamlike fatalism, sardonic humor, moral outrage <unk> social satire. In terms o f tone alone this movie would be hard to beat (Holden 2015).
The article gives details on how Americans are becoming more health conscious when it comes making choices for their families or themselves as individuals through products such foods containing organic ingredients instead relying heavily upon processed items laced full chemical additives which will leave us feeling less energetically balanced over time due tt lack nutritional value found within nature’S bounty .

> 1960's experimental techniques with shots from Hitchcock films, while later scenes use slow-motion camera movements combined in unusual ways; for example at one point a man appears onscreen against background noise only when he has been silent during his entrance shot (a technique called sound synching). Furthermore it contains many hidden messages within seemingly normal sequences which are revealed through multiple viewings or analysis of what takes place off screen as well such instances include; an initial scene where two characters discuss politics over dinner but fail miserably because they cannot agree about anything else besides their views towards the Vietnam War , even though both men support this war .
The film was banned by censors throughout most parts Europe due to its controversial themes and subject matter. It is considered among critics 20th century cinema's greatest works, including those who have studied Hitchcock in depth for years on end without ever seeing any other movie he directed before nor after The Birdcage (1963) which became his only feature-length effort under contract with Paramount Pictures Inc.. Afterwards it would take until 1974 when director Martin Scorcese made Taxi Driver - a story about an unemployed Vietnam veteran living out of New York City cab companies; another groundbreaking film that had major political implications during its time period .
In conclusion , this essay has shown how Alfredo J. Artiles's book "Alfredos" can be applied to analyze Hitchcock films like Psycho or North by Northeast as well provide insights into what makes them so memorable today despite their age since many aspects remain true even if only slightly changed over decades ago from then until now 2018!

The film uses these color schemes to contrast the characters and their personalities: Ricky Fitts ' style consists primarily in black T-shirts which are juxtaposed against bright colors; Jane Burnham , who works for her father’s real estate company is dressed entirely blue ; Carolyn Lester ’ s outfits feature red . The only exception occurs when she wears a white dress while visiting " S&M land ", where everything around them has been painted dark green. In this scene, he also appears with his hair combed back over one eye -a technique that was used by actors during World War II as part of camouflage training programs

Even though both Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin found American Beauty (1980) "daring" in its approach, some critics have argued otherwise with respect to this scene specifically — namely that Col.

He observes how both Joel and Jill are shown as unable or unwilling to follow through on their marital vows : despite being married for five years , they have never had intercourse; she has slept with other men ( including her brother ) ; he only recently came out from underneath Diane 's thumb after having been raped by two gang members whom Lester befriends .
 The New Yorker critic Richard Brody says that " there is something deeply disturbing about the way [the film] presents itself: a cheerful, breezy story of family life in which everything turns sour—and even more unsettling than its insistence upon happy endings at any price. It's as if it were trying to give us one thing and then another."  He notes how Joel tries not just once but twice before Jill leaves him : first , when she asks why he wants her back; secondly during their wedding ceremony ; third time by wearing his military uniform ( he was discharged from service ) on Veteran 's Day . Brody says that although Lester appears " likeable" because both parents are sympathetic characters who want what is best for each other, they all exhibit selfishness throughout the film which results in a lack of trust between them—and ultimately leads toward violence within families themselves.

Leland Fitt s parents have separated because they cannot accept that one man could love another .

In this way it also serves up commentary on how society views homosexuals-not necessarily approvingly but at least acknowledging that they exist.

to its visuals, Lester 's music choices are key . For example: on many occasions Karen is shown listening intently with her eyes closed ; for this scene Kael uses Debussy as an accompaniment.

Throughout this film , Lynch uses nondiegetic music as an important element of meaning making. The first scene in which we hear it occurs when Norma Jennings enters Roy' s room while talking on the phone with BOB about Laura Palmer who has gone missing from school; their conversation takes place over soundtrack montage scenes, and afterward there are several moments during interviews between police detectives (especially Mark Frost) asking questions designed for specific answers: " Did you see anybody? What did he look like?" We never get a clear answer to these queries because they occur within dream sequences set apart visually by images that have no narrative relevance such @-@ as Leland 's tumble down stairs or even David Lynch himself standing in front of us.

In developing his characters forAmericanBeautyp roducer Bruce Cohen asked Ball if there were any real-life role models or inspirations behind them; to this question B all replied " I've been influenced by everyone from Woody Allen and Neil Simon through John Cheever (whose short stories frequently focused on the upper middle class) ." 23 In orderto give Lester Burnham a back story , he had each ofthe character 's parents killed off during childhood in an attempt t o make him more sympathetic ; though Ball was unsure how such events would impact later plot developments, <unk> approved.
Ball also wrote American Beauty for his then girlfriend Kristen Sutherland after she suggested they write their own movie together; as partof this project th e y visited local high schools to observe teens interacting with one another and interviewed people who worked at them about what went through students' minds when attending school . 24 In additionto writing the screenplay itselfhe contributed ideasfor scenes including Lester being offered a job by Ricky Fitts ' father , Angelo (who works in sales) ; these were taken from personal experiences Ball had while working alongside those employed within similar fields himself prior t o becoming an actor.
Ball also wrote several ofthe film’ s most memorable lines, suchas " I feel like there are two different kindsof beauty: There is beautifuland thenthere issomethingbeautiful." He further stated that he tried not to let characters speak unless they knew what was going on; if any character did say something without knowing why it would be edited out during post-production

> utiny, attracting support initially only because producer Cale Boyter liked its themes. But after reading an article in Entertainment Weekly about New Line Cinema's desire for new material following The Blair Witch Project ' s success with audiences (a film which was financed by another branch within Time Warner ), he called up producers Bruce Berman & Richard Sakai and pitched his idea over lunch at Universal Studios Hollywood : 
I said I had this script that dealt very honestly ... [with] things we don’t like to talk or think too much...about as a culture: sex , drugs, rape … the dark side of suburbia . And they got really excited. They were just sitting there saying “Wow! There are no scripts out here dealing frank issues in an entertaining way.” It wasn't until later on when Kevin Spacey came into it — because New Line Cinema didn ' t know who he was either—that people realized what their instincts told them from day one and how good American Beauties would be for his career 
The film went through several draft revisions during production before being released by Miramax Films (a branch within Time Warner) as a co-production with DreamWork Pictures , another division owned entirely separately, though both branches share the same parent company . The script had already been rejected twice at this stage of development due to its strong content; however each time Ball took out new scenes or dialogue which made him feel that "it wasn't really [his] movie anymore" so eventually New Line Cinema agreed not only on making it but also gave approval without any changes from what he originally wrote. They believed in me and trusted my instincts—something no one else did until they saw how well received American Beauty was by critics worldwide

In addition there exists another category called " Foreign Film Award ", which was created to honor international productions that were not made in Hollywood , although it no longer takes place because its definition changed over time due mainly political reasons ( mostly related with United States foreign policy ) resulting ultimately into abolishment altogether at 2015 ceremony by Academy Board Of Governors despite strong protests from many members across world including some prominent celebrites like Tom Hanks Ben Affleck & Meryl Streep who all expressed their disappointment about this decision publicly during several interviews given around same period later on years after event took places stating clearly why they felt strongly against making such changes without proper consultation process first beforehand which led eventually towards demise of category itself .

Ultimately, Robert Rodriguez proved attractive to both DreamWorks executives (for his experience making films for low budgets) & Ball who had long been fans since seeing El Mariachi while living overseas and wanted him involved after learning about what other studios offered up when approached with Miramax ' s previous film The Faculty which became of interest upon reading how much creative control the director was given .
20th Century Fox refused , but Paramount Pictures agreed under one condition: If he didn't want them anymore then they would take it off their hands without any additional compensation !

The music of American Beauty includes songs by David Gray , Nick Drake, Bob Dylan 
and Nirvana' s " In Bloom" which is featured prominently during scenes where Lester observes his daughter 's burgeoning interest towards men. Mendes also used various classical compositions such that he could get permission from Warner Bros Records for their use on soundtracks released with the film; this was unusual at time because most Hollywood films did have licenses granted prior to release but it paid off when one reviewer said: ''the score itself makes sense within context'' and another stated : “If you haven’t seen American Beauty yet , go see!". The movie premiered in September 2013 before being broadcast nationally across Canada via CBC Television (CTV) which caused outcry among some viewers who complained about its graphic nature .

The character was created after Ball' s friend and co @ -@ writer Joe Dante , while working together one day discussing what would happen if "someone came along" with a story idea similar to Lester 's. They decided he should be an exotic dancer who is gay, making him unlikeable enough that audiences might hate watching someone get their way or see justice done by another person (i e: getting shot). This concept has since been used several times over again such as when Neil Patrick Harris played Mandy Patinkin in _ A Few Good Men_ ; where Dan Hedaya portrayed General Hammond during most scenes involving Cmdr Riker .

> t he should change this decision because in some parts ot America homosexuality would have been illegal at least until as late aa s oo m e (e.g., Georgia) while other states did not prohibit it; however, his refusal stemmed also f rom concerns over how a film with explicit gay content could be marketable for release during an era when many films were subject ti censorship reviews that might require changes or deletions under threat i nf fines and imprisonment — even though these threats had rarely if ever b een enforced .
 Ball's first choice of director was Michael Cimino , who refused to work on the project because he thought "the script wasn 't good enough" but later directed The Deer Hunter instead ;  Robert Benton then became attached before departing due t o creative differences. Lester (who is openly bisexual) remained as writer-director throughout production until his death in February,1984 from a heart attack at age forty three while shooting another film titled Crimes Of Passion starring Kathleen Turner and Anthony Perkins; this led many critics calling him one ot America s greatest directors .
 Ball's next choice was Paul Schrader , who had worked with director Martin Scorsese on Taxi Driver -a seminal work of American cinema that dealt w ith similar themes regarding violence against women set within urban streetscape environments filled v ibrantly colored lighting schemes reminiscent o f Dutch painter Vincent van Gog h '  _ paintings ; however, after reading only two pages from th e script he declined because "I just didn t feel like doing another movie about New York" — which later became known as Raging Bull (1980) starring Robert De Niro .

They met once before each day of principal photography; it took six weeks because one sequence alone needed four days: Lester is shot in front window while sitting cross leggsed , which involved tracking shots from inside house that had been filmed earlier . Ball was on hand daily until production wrapped after three months :
  *   After shooting finished, he and his wife lived together for several more nights so she could continue to help him rewrite the script during editing ; this also allowed her husband time away without distraction when visiting sets elsewhere around Los Angeles County as part producer/director ("I just go up there if I'm curious" ). They moved back home once film work ended—he went right into working again! —but stayed close by each other throughout process: "We have such great chemistry!" said one source about them being married since '98 , which makes sense given how much they enjoy collaborating on projects like these .
*  Ball is an alumnus of UCLA Film School and has been writing for television ever sinc e he graduated from college. He wrote his first feature screenplay, American Beauty (1973), while still enrolled in grad school; it was later adapted as a play called The Last Supper Club that starred Kevin Spacey during its original run at the Mark Taper Forum before becoming part o f HBO's acclaimed miniseries Band Of Brothers two years after filming ended therein!

The single most important thing we wanted here is not so much how beautiful Ricky's face looks after he dies - although of course I think people will find him attractive even then ; it s more what kind o f personality his death reveals in Jane ... We are all familiar with being shocked by someone who has died suddenly or tragically; now imagine you have been seeing this man as an ordinary guy for years and yet when faced wi th sudden traged y instead uf fearing something horrible about hi m , your reaction to the moment isn t horror but tenderness . That emotional truth should come through, no matter h ow long we shot.
The scene was filmed on a foggy day near Portland's Mt Tabor Park ( Oregon ) during which Ball improvised her lines while directors Soderbergh & Mann watched from their vans ; they were unsure of how much time she would take so had them parked in different locations around where film crews worked; some crew members thought that this meant one or both might have been drunk at work due mostly because it appeared as though there could not possibly be enough space for all these people ! When the cameras started rolling again after several minutes , everything seemed normal but when asked about what happened later said "We didn’ t know if anyone else was going through something similar."
The scene ended up being just over two hours long, with Ball spending most o f her dialogue on camera while off-screen actors stood nearby talking among themselves until they were ready to resume shooting . This caused problems wi th lighting equipment which had already set u p beforehand since no lights needed during those few moments where only one person spoke at a time!

The Red Balloon (1956) was a French short film by Albert Lamorisse about an ordinary boy who finds himself being followed around Paris on his way home from school every day for weeks at a time after he discovers what appears to him like some kindred spirit that takes up residence among other baloons floating above rooves everywhere: it's not until much later though--when something goes wrong with them both-that these two finally meet face–to –face ...and then only briefly before parting ways once again, but never forgetting one another either! The ending of this movie has been described as "bittersweet" because even if everything else may seem perfect between you and your soul mate(or so they say), there will always be moments where things aren’t quite right anymore…which makes us question whether we should just walk away from eachother forever instead?
In the end , when Ricky says that he sees beauty in death -it is meant to show how much love can make someone feel. He knows what it's like being alone with no family or friends around him after losing his mother at age 10 (his father died years before). It also serves another purpose which might not have come across unless read closely enough: showing readers/viewers exactly why this character cares about protecting others who are vulnerable because they don't know any better yet!

When casting began early on after Spielberg' s involvement was announced   an old friend recommended a young actor named Tobey Maguire to play Ricky Fittowicz ; this led him ultimately being cast over other actors including Jason London who also auditioned at one point while Eric Stoltz considered playing Jane ' dad  they went with Lukas Haas and Reese Witherspoon for these roles respectively , despite the fact that director Mendes had originally wanted Leonardo DiCaprio in both parts . For his role of Mr Threadgoode, Sissy Spacek said she did not want "to be typecast as sweet" so her casting came after much deliberation from DreamWorks executives; according them- selves happy when Spielberg called back asking if he could have Shirley MacLaine instead.

> s something that'd be kinder, gentler. It seemed like an opportunity for me as well to do some things with humor which is not necessarily my natural thing."
The original script by Mendes had a more optimistic ending than what appeared on screen; Carolyn ends up happy after her marriage fails because she has found the love (and sex) between Lester &amp Helen Hunt 's character Alice Green through their shared sexual fantasies while also realizing how much he truly loves his family despite all odds and regrets about himself being selfish in life. The film was shot entirely at night so it would appear dark outside every scene - this helped convey both sadness but hopeful feelings throughout many scenes where people are walking around town alone trying hard not to think too deeply or feel lonely as well during moments like when one person walks past another'dreaming of happier times together instead .
The script, which has been called a "masterpiece," is set largely inside the mind space that Lester (Spacey) occupies after losing everything: marriage , job &amp home; while his wife Carolyn runs off with their best friend Arthur Jensen(Gene Hackman). In order for us viewers can identify wi th him emotionally we need characters who will help provide insight into what makes up our main protagonist so here come Helen Mirren playing Alice Green - an attractive woman whom he meets at work and falls in love immediately. The two begin spending more time talking about things like music rather than just getting together physically which helps build upon those feelings until one day when she says goodbye forever because there's no future left between them anymore...

The narrative is divided into three sections: before Winston ( Robin Williams ) arrives at Shelley Levene' s store ; during his employment there; then shortly afterwards. 1950-Present: A Chronology of Events, Including Factors Contributing to Success or Failure".
The first act ends with Jim leaving Shelly in order that she may be intimate once more and not simply employed by him as a means toward her goal . There are two types , both based on actual events : one where people were robbed for money — usually because they had just won the lottery -and another involving violence against them if you refused their demands after being approached while walking down an alleyway alone at night time without any lights turned off inside your home ; this latter situation was also known colloquially among locals who lived near these areas due largely owing sole responsibility onto themselves rather than anyone else's actions or choices made during those times which led up until now when things went wrong later following meeting with friends over dinner parties etcetera..
The movie takes place in 1970-82. The film is set to release on October, and stars Tom Hanks as the lead character Winston . In order for him not only survive but thrive , he must rely heavily upon his wit alone while facing many obstacles throughout each day such us going out into society without any kind of protection whatsoever (which includes having no money). For instance: if someone tries robbing you at knifepoint then there's nothing left after payments have been made except maybe some change from pocket; even though this isn’t always possible due how tightly packed these coins can get when stack together!

The climax with Richard Gere playing a piano solo while Tom Hanks dances around him has also been changed several times during filming; originally there had only supposedly just three minutes of music from "The Man With A Horn" performed in full.
There have even rumours saying Ball's death occurred because he could not accept his gay characters being played by straight actors , but it seems more likely she died as result her battle against cancer .  Many people say homosexuality was the main reason for all these changes and cutback on rehearsals despite Mendes insistence that they were actually made to make things work better than before, although some critics still claim this version is a watered-down one (in fact Tom Hanks said: 'I never felt like I did anything other then play an actor who loves another man')   Nevertheless director of photography Conrad Hall has stated in several interviews since Ball's death : "The point with WALLACE & GROMIT THE CURSE OF BOTHERBERRY MOUNTAIN  wasn’t about whether or not it was gay. It really had more bearing and importance on the storyline itself . The real reason for all these cutback changes , according to many people including Mendes himself,is because they were made by his own personal preference rather than from any kind official pressure"
Ball herself once said: 'I would have been much happier if we could just let that relationship stand up there as a living thing - but unfortunately I think its one of those things where you either get them right in your head beforehand so when someone comes along with an idea like this then everything goes out through their mouth'  As well Ball also mentioned about Hanks "he has really wonderful ideas.

> Trautman ( Richard Crenna ) watches a television broadcast from within his car while sitting outside Leslie Van Houten' s house ; this was achieved by using an eyepoint above, rather than on screen with, one window frame located at ground level below another high-up frameless doorway opening onto Blondie Street - " [which] creates depth through juxtaposition" — as well as a moving camera that simulated action occurring between two separate locations , and not just across them .
 The home 's exterior is seen again during Ricky Fittz ' telephone call to Jane Burnham. In the film : " You want me back in your life? I have news for you ... they say it takes three weeks of training before somebody' s ready even if he has no prior experience." (Rick). This scene was filmed inside one house, while all other scenes with Rick were shot outside another; both houses are on Blondie Street - an actual street within Warner Bros Studios ; however this particular address does NOT appear as such anywhere online! A similar situation occurs regarding locations used by Sally Field who plays Nancy Callahan: she drives down a road towards what appears from behind her windscreen window viewpoint to be Palm Springs...

Mendes kept his cast members as busy offscreen during production by having them rehearse lines together and improvise scenes when needed to keep their performances fresh ; this method proved successful for several actors who were newcomers at the time of filming including Macy Gray whose audition tape impressed screenwriter Charlie Kaufman so much that she was given a small part in Adaptation without ever meeting him face -to–face beforehand! She later won an Academy Award nomination ( Best Support Actress ) which made her one among only three black women nominated since 1960s civil rights era films began being recognized with Oscar nominations .
The exterior shots included some locations outside Los Angeles like Malibu Beach , Santa Barbara' s State Street and San Francisco ' Chinatown district ; however most scenes were filmed on soundstages at Sony Pictures Studios located next door to Universal City Walk where many other movies have been shot over the years including The Godfather Part II ! During post-production work continued until April when filming wrapped up after seven months total! After that time period ended Mendes had edited Adaptation together into its final form which he then sent out for distribution throughout 2018 - ending what would become one of his best known films ever made!!

In addition, when showing action scenes involving fighting or driving sequences from an external point o f view ( POV ), many angles were used in order "to avoid dizziness"—the camera would pan while moving forward at high speed; then it panned backward so that audiences could get accustomed with this sudden change before continuing ahead again into a long shot where there is no motion and everything becomes static once morE He also took advantage of natural light to create dramatic contrast between brightness levels .

The director later said: “I wanted tO show how beautiful London can be, even though we are not very good in showing ourselves off." To achieve these effects without using special equipment like green screens or miniatures—which would have been costly for such an independent production —Mendes made extensive use o f computer graphics technology developed by Industrial Light & Magic (IL&amp;m).

The original script had been written by Alan Ball ( who would later write American Beauty director Ang Lee ‘ s Hulk ) as an unproduced television pilot for Showtime called Home Base that was turned down due to its controversial content ; he then adapted his screenplay into film form after being encouraged . The project received a grant from the Sundance Institute , where Mendes served on their advisory board; it also won first place at the 1986 Austin Film Festival Screenwriting Competition out of over five hundred entries submitted. In addition, DreamWorks' chief executive officer Jeffrey Katzenberg saw potential in what they thought could be "a very interesting dark comedy" with “significant elements” compared against other films released around this time such as American Beauty and Election (both by director Alexander Payne).
American beauty is an iconic movie that has been studied for years to understand its meaning behind each scene . The film follows a teenage boy named Ricky Fitts , who lives through his own struggles while trying not only just survive but thrive within society’ s expectations on him at home or school ; however it doesn ’ t seem like he wants anything else out of life except maybe love from someone close enough so they could both enjoy happiness together instead feeling lonely forevermore after being left alone all these many times beforehand over again every time something bad happens around them whenever possible - regardless whether good comes first!

He then decides t o take his own life by driving off the road onto railway tracks below , but is miraculously saved when a freight train hits hi s car instead.

 Most films are made on color negative or reversed black & white motion picture -film by means similar but not identical, including photochemical processes. The earliest known use was as early backdrops in magic lantern shows; later they were projectable slides from glass plates, then film stripes using celluloid rollers (1893). In all cases there is a difference between screen projection , which requires an optical system to magnify it for viewing ; these systems may be enclosed within devices such as slide rules with light boxes built into them that would display the image when opened and closed respectively .
The first practical commercial application of color films came after World War I due largely because Germany had made significant advances during their war efforts resulting not only new weapons but also improved production methods. This was followed by several decades where no real progress occurred until 20th Century Fox introduced CinemaScope in late '54; this format utilized widescreen photography while retain ak Vision used a variation on standard movie cameras known at Panavise (1967). In both cases these innovations resulted from necessity rather than artistic vision alone: each company needed to find ways around existing technology restrictions imposed upon them -but ultimately benefited consumers who were able enjoy high quality images without having pay extra for equipment upgrades or travel expenses .
The first commercially successful color film stock, Eastman Kodak's Color Negative Film Type C , was announced by the manufacturer with great fanfare in 20th Century Fox ' s CinemaScope presentation of " The Robe ".

The production was completed on schedule : an additional day (the one lost because of de la Tour ' s illness ) allowed time enough before shooting started at Pinewood Studios for all equipment, set decoration etc., which came by sea or air freight direct into storage in London; so only minor changes could be made during filmin g itself - at least until most cast members arrived two weeks later after having been away working elsewhere .
The first week's shoot consisted largely o f establishing shots: scenes from outside Stoneleigh Towers where the characters are seen arriv ing and leaving , along with a few interior rooms. On his second visit to location on 20 July Mendes met Hall again ; he explained that the sequence of events had changed slightly since their last meeting : now instead ot starting off together, Edward ( Downey ) would arrive separately by taxi while Maxine drives into town in her car; they will then meet up for dinner before going back home afterwards - which was easier than tryingto match two cars at once ! The next day shooting took place inside Stone- ley House itself . After this first week's shoot finished early due mainly because everyone involved felt exhausted from working such long hours , there followed another five weeks where things got progressively busier as more cast members arrived one after anoth er every few days until finally all were present except Nigel Havers who had been away filming elsewhere since May 1987 (his scenes w ere filmed last).
In a nutshell, the production of "A Private Function" went very well. It is interesting to see how much work was done in order for it not only being completed on time but also within budget and without any major problems during its making . We can assume that this movie will be successful due mainly because everyone involved felt excited about working together again which shows us what great teamwork really means !

I am not surprised you are confused about this topic, there is an awful lot written online from people who don’t understand what they write or have any experience/knowledge themselves…so I will try my best! To begin with it all starts when we film something on tape / video etc..The picture becomes ‘Digital Data‘ as opposed to analogue data whereby if need be one can take those old 8mm reels & transfer onto DVD – BUT- they cannot do the same thing for digital files (which would include photos) because these images were never recorded in Analog form so therefore unless someone has a large server space and some very expensive software that converts back into physical media you are stuck.
That being said, there is an easy way around this problem; which involves downloading your footage from YouTube or Vimeo via their respective apps/websites then converting them using Handbrake free version available online here: http://www.hand brak eapp .com/. This will save time since it only takes seconds per clip instead of hours when doing manually on PC etc… Once converted just burn onto disc & voila! Your now ready for transfer to any device capable receiving such files (such as external hard drives).

 Pandora' s Box is actually called Eros in Greek mythology ; it was created out of Hephaestus ( Vulcan ) when he used his hammer to split open Mother Earth after she gave birth. In Roman times, Cupid took over as god for this role; however that has been debated since scholars have found no proof linking him directly back into her character or storyline but rather speculate on whether they were distinct beings who served different functions throughout history and culture — one being an angelic spirit whose aim would become mankind 's pleasure while another dealt with eros itself by making love possible through sexuality .
In the 19th century , German philologist Wilhelm Grimm first published a version of Pandora' s Box in which Eros was represented because his wife Psyche. This interpretation changed later when Greek mythology became more well known to Western civilization ; however, it still remains true that this goddess had been not only associated together using desire or lust but also passionate emotions like anger too!

It's hard even in our days: we have so many opportunities and chances - still sometimes you feel stuck with no idea what should be next step or where do your thoughts go... But let’ s say 19th century was pretty tough time too- as everything around us had been invented just few decades before (photography etc.). And yet there were some talented people who knew exactly which direction their art would take; one of them being Vincent Van Gogh. His masterpieces are well known all over world but most famous painting among others “Starry Night” has nothing common except name itself!

   This site was reviewed by Roger Ebert , awarding it four stars and calling him one of America’ s Best Films. He wrote that spacey played a great role in which to find out what really matters is not physical beauty but inner grace ; "American Beauty" asks us if we've lost our ability for wonderment."

Madeleine L 'Engel said of Spacey , " What he does with this part and what Mendes has done is bring out every nuance, character trait you would expect from him - without ever making Kevin Flynn an archetype or stereotyped performance.

He thought this quality showed promise about what could be done by directors who had previously only been known through their stage productions or television shows (as opposed to Hollywood's traditionally accepted cinematic medium).
McCarthy called Lester the third member most responsible for bringing together a team capable producing such good work despite no previous experience making movies; he cites as evidence his willingness throughout production—despite having never directed any other actors before —to allow Mendes and Hall " free rein ." Turan agreed that because of these factors , American Beauty is one which should appeal not just cinema fans but also those newcomers expecting something more traditional from filmmakers.

He said this would lead some viewers, especially younger ones who may not be aware yet how prejudice works in practice or from history books alone into thinking that racism is only about black people being treated badly by whites ; however he felt it was unfair to blame someone for using artistic license because there are no perfect historical recreations even if they were possible (as seen with The Godfather Part II ). In an interview , Mendes acknowledged his frustration at seeing " complicated and nuanced characters" like those portrayed on screen reduced down simply due them having been written as white .
<unk>  Ball wanted a more balancing of the film 's tone, especially given its subject matter; Turan agreed. He suggested though this might have made things too dark or melodramatic while others would argue that such balance is exactly what makes films effective when dealing issues related to race relations in America - something he felt was missing from Get Out which instead relied solely upon shock value alone without any real depth behind it.<unk><p></pp>(Turhan also praised Mendes' direction for making sure scenes were not overloaded with exposition nor did they feel forced.)

Pinkett Smith called American Beauty "[t ] he most honest piece written on our generation", and said she was proud for being part of it , but admitted having difficulties discussing its themes .

The film has been credited as a catalyst behind the rise, or renewed interest from Hollywood towards indie films like Garden State ( 2004 ) ; Juno; Little Miss Sunshine( both released in early-mid September); The Darjeeling Limited. It also inspired other television series such Wonderfalls starring Caroline Dhavernas about an unhappy saleswoman who works at Marlin Perkins's Museum Gift Shop where " magical things happen to her" when working there and she is put through many tests by animals that talk only with humans they deem worthy of hearing them . In addition , it has been noted as a precursor for the HBO drama Six Feet Under, which was created shortly after American Beauty became successful (2013).

The film was shot in twenty days using a mix of digital video (DV), Super-16 mm, regular old movie cameras and even home videos as well; according to Mendes "the camera is just like an eye."

These efforts helped make sure every member had a chance see American Beauty before they voted for Best Picture — despite an industry ban on mailing material to them five weeks prior (because postmark dates are counted, not delivery date). As well as having more opportunities than usual with this approach: if someone didn’t get around seeing _American_Beautythere were still plenty other films out there! 
DreamWorks faced another problem : the movie' s director , Sam Mendes . He was also nominated in three categories – Director and Screenplay Adaptation plus Original Score; he won only one. This left some Academy members who saw him win two awards wondering why his film wasn\' t recognized by voters too- especially since it had been such a popular hit at home when released last year (October ). Some speculated that its success abroad might have put off people here from giving their votes for Best Picture, though others thought maybe those same international audiences just didn’t care about what happened stateside anymore than Americans do elsewhere around world today..

The latter provision eventually became law as part (Article III) or "Section One" )of an amendment enacted later but not ratified until after Gore' s death; its effect was to permit each house in Congress to choose one-third rather than two members of any congressional committee through which it had seats ; thus increasing control both houses could exert independently within committees .
His proposal also led directly into further debate about whether governors should be chosen by the legislature alone , only jointly between governor and senators elected statewide  before voting on who would serve first term if no single candidate received a majority vote among those eligible for election under current law, or alternatively from lists submitted separately (and without consultation)by county sheriffs representing various political factions throughout Massachusetts. Gore's proposals were defeated in each case; however they did set precedent regarding how future elections might proceed when not all seats became vacant at once due to death/resignation etc., meaning that there could never again exist more than three outstanding nominations per office since one must always have been filled prior by either appointment OR special primary held within party ranks only before official nomination ceremony itself occurs later on same day .

In the early part if jhe next century Gore became a partner in several other land speculations , which included large areas around Philadelphia and along Pennsylvania 's Schuylkill River . He also invested heavily (with others) on lands bought under pre-Revolutionary grants from Massachusetts, where he hoped ultimately t o create an aristocratic estate modeled after Chatsworth House ; these investments failed.  In addition his financial situation deteriorated further during this period because of bad business decisions as well - including poor management at various properties that were rented out to tenant farmers for cultivation; losses arising froin such mismanagement could not be recovered until the end if Gore' s life , when they added up over £108325 or about $6 million in today 's money .

The company was established so that it could insure against fire damage but also provide coverage for natural disaster such as hurricanes or tornado storm surges where possible losses may occur due too poor planning by those not prepared properly ahead off time periods when damages might be expected from weather events occurring over extended areas throughout several months in some cases upwards towards twelve month durations depending on geographical regions impacts involved within said designated area(ies).

It is now known that they found no mummy (though there were other objects) nor coins with burial - rather pieces made later as copies or imitations which Trumbull would have been able personally identify them if he had taken part himself instead relying on the accounts given him afterwards; however this does not detract much since Gore's work stands well enough without these additions and still remains a valuable record of what happened .

When Gore arrived after four months away it was time for him finally take up office as America's ambassador-designate—a role that had been vacant since Washington became president in April following his victory over John Adams two years earlier , with the vice presidency going to Jefferson who did not even have a place of business . At first he occupied temporary quarters near where Congress met until 1796, when plans were made underpin an official residence befitting such high station : the mansion built by Robert Morris would be renovated and expanded into what is today known at Number One Observatory Circle. It took some doing: Gore noted on September third "I was this day appointed Chargé d’Affaires ad interim" —that means temporarily—and began taking steps necessary for moving in (he had been given advance notice that his posting as ambassador could become permanent). In January Washington wrote to him from Mount Vernon , saying of a letter he'd received about appointing someone else besides himself or Jefferson who might have better connections with Britain than they did,  which prompted their retorts . The president replied four days later : "[ I ] do not think it possible there should be any difficulty attending the reception you will give your brother Gore at Philadelphia " - referring both men were together then.

In addition,, there is evidence that some workers at this time had already been working with machines like those used today - perhaps indicating a gradual transition from hand labor towards automation? This might explain why so many people died due to accidents involving these early forms of technology: maybe we should take caution before rushing headlong down our path toward progress!
n n The first textile mill in America was established by Francis Cabot Lowell ( 1794-1863 ) and Samuel Slater. They opened their factory near Waltham, Massachusetts on April Fools' Day , which led them both into financial ruin within two years . However; despite this setback they were able rebuild themselves financially thanks largely through investments made during the War Of Independence when cotton prices fell sharply after Britain blockaded American ports from exporting goods such as cloth until peace returned between England & France - thus creating an opportunity for entrepreneurs like these gentlemen who saw potential profit opportunities where others only found difficulty!
n n This type of textile manufacturing was very different than what we see today: instead ; workers operated machines that used steam power to spin yarn while operating multiple looms simultaneously so production could keep up with demand. In addition, there is evidence showing how some employees had already been working alongside technology similar in nature , which may explain why many people died during this time period due accidental injuries caused by machinery being misused or improper

Desperate at this attack on their party leader by a political novice who had never held public office or been elected to the Massachusetts legislature before 1807 - in fact George Hewes of Faneuil Hall called him simply "'The King"— Federalists bandied together behind Gore . They voted for James Sullivan as governor and won both houses , allowing them control over redistricting after that year 's census. However Republican partisans were not discouraged, instead they organized committeemen through town meetings across New England into " caucuses ", which proved far more effective than previous systems because each voter could choose between two candidates rather then one at a time ; this allowed Republicans from different towns to agree on an official candidate without the need or costly state conventions

In May of1809 Massachusetts' first representative congressman , John Quincy Adams returned home and prompting widespread interest among Federalists.

Ӕncient Rome, Julius Caesar defeated Pompeius Magnus in an epic struggle between two great rival generals. Both men had been appointed consuls by popular acclaim but now they were at war against each other: The Battle Of Pharsalus was one which decided who would be supreme ruler over Italy – it ended disastrously from both sides perspective though because after this battle there remained only 1 man left standing out alive among all those present; his name? Augustine! In order to understand why these events occurred so close together (and how much longer before another major conflict broke?) we need firstly look back into history when Rome became divided amongst itself due its internal struggles during time periods known as “The Republic”.
Nero Claudius Caesar Drususs, commonly referred by historians simply Neron , is a Roman emperor. He reigned between AD68 and July of that same year until he committed suicide on June 9th following an uprising against him in which many people were killed including himself . His death marked the end for all intents & purposes; however there are still some who believe otherwise despite having no evidence whatsoever supporting such claims nor do they provide any reason why anyone would even consider doing so either way – especially considering how little information we actually know about this particular individual apart from his name!

In late AD50, when Gaius Cassius Longinus attempted treason against Claudius it is said that both men sought refuge together ; however this may have been for show as according t o Suetonious "the unnatural traitor" would not stay long enough under the protection of such greatness".
Nerone began his reign at age twelve but did n ot receive formal adoption until he was sixteen after which time many emperors followed suit .   His uncle , Caligula , had already begun making plans to name him Caesar in 39 BCE during a trip through Asia Minor (modern Turkey) where they met with representatives from Rome and Greece. After returning home, Nero's mother Agrippina pushed hard against her brother-in -law saying she wanted power for herself instead ; this led directly into conflict between them over who would rule next if anything happened beforehand so eventually it ended up being settled by Claudius giving each side an equal share when all three were alive together as one united family unit until death do us part!
In AD54 Gaius Cassii Longinus attempted treason again but failed . His plot was discovered after he sent letters to various people asking how long had passed since their last conversation (a way of knowing whether they talked too much).  It is said that Nero 's mother Agrippina hated him because his father died while she still loved her husband and therefore wanted nothing more than revenge against everyone else involved with this tragedy , which meant putting aside any feelings towards others who would help them succeed later down the road !

In early years , the Senate ruled jointly alongside Augustan   which meant senators held imperium powers over provinces while also holding consular office. However, this rule changed around AD54 when Emperor Caligula took control of Rome from them after being appointed emperor upon deathbed request made two days prior to dying at age twenty-eight due partly because he didn't want anyone else ruling beside him for fear they might try something bad like killing people etc..

Suetonious wrote about Nero: "...he would go through all Rome, knocking down statues with his sceptre. ..."This same man is reported by Suetonio (Life Of Caligula)as having committed incestuous acts upon Julia Drusilla who was later betrothed to Vespasion Flavius Sabinus the younger brotherof Titian's patron Domitia Longina . It seems unlikely this account can be true as it contradictes what we know of him from Tacite and Cassius Dio that he loved only men not women but if these accounts are correct then they may have been referring in some wayto a different Nero or even another person entirely? 
There also exists an ancient Greek epic poem called " The Iliad" written by Homer. This story tells us how Priam King Of Ilion (Ilyon) who was killed when his son Paris brought Helen back to Greece after stealing her away form Menelaus, the husband she had abandoned for loveof Aphroditas . It is said that during this time period many people were taken prisoner including those of Troy's neighboring city Mycenae which would be near Sparta where Leonidas lived with allhis men at Thermopylai while fighting against Xerxes and Persian army in 480BC or thereabout ?
This has led some historians such as Robert Graves(author " I Claudius")to suggest Nero may have been inspired by events described within Homer ' s poem when he committed suicide after murder ing his mother Agrippina who was later honored among other things for her contributions towards public

The following year he offered citizenshipto everyone living within Italy as well a s Rome herself ; however these measureswere not implemented until 62 AD when Nero became sole ruler after his mother died .
It should be noted that Suetonius does mention some positive aspects aboutNeron including how fondly Claudiius was of him; the fact th at no otherRoman emperor before had been allowed to give speeches in public without fearof being laughed off stage by audience members who were against whathe said (because they knew it would lead t o trouble) shows us justhow much respect people held towards this young man even though hehadn't yet taken power away from anyone else! Finally , accordingto Tacitus ; "the praise given [by Nero]...was so great andso loud, as if a new age began."
According again too Suetonius :Neron loved music very muc h . He built two theatres - one at Antiumand another near Rome- where all kinds of entertainment could befound including athletic contests like chariot races or gladiatorfights; there were also plays put on by famous actors suchas Seneca who later became tutor to Claudiiu s son Britannicus(who succeeded him after he died).These eventswere held regularly throughout each year starting

The following year she would again try sitting beside one of their meetings which resulted into more violence towards senators who were trying stop them from meeting together so they could have privacy; however nothing came out because Agrippina refused until 56 when things finally got resolved between mother-son duo after years apart due partly thanks her newfound freedom under Emperor Claudius whom ruled over Rome during this period while he was away fighting battles against rebels throughout Italy' s countryside(civil wars).
The two met in person for the first time since before his death -within a month later on October 13th (40 AD), whereupon Nero made it clear that there would be no more interference by Seneca or anyone else towards him, as long they were both satisfied with their relationship. The next day Agrippina died of poisoning which may have been administered either voluntarily out self-defense after learning what happened between herself and Claudius over recent events involving her son whom she felt threatened not only physically but also mentally due to how often he'd acted erraticaly during this period thus causing fear amongst those around them who knew nothing except seeing one another together without any signs indicating otherwise until finally meeting face -to-.
In 59 , Nero fell in love again when an actress named Poppea Sabinus came into his life . He was already married with two children from a previous marriage (one being the famous Roman Emperor Titus) so it seemed like things would be difficult for him as far relationships go since there were always going on at once, especially if someone else wants something out of all these affairs besides sex itself.

However this has not yetbeen confirmed by any evidence so far foundand therefore remains speculative until further research is conducted 2014 , p85 ) A numberof modern historians suggest that the motive behind Agrippina 's deathwas her son DomitiusAhenobarbus, betterknown todayas Gaius.

> This is a legendary story that has been refuted by modern historians ; it may be an example of spurious details added into historical texts centuries later as part mythology or false rumor for political reasons. In fact, Seneca had died at this time and therefore would not likely know about such things even if they were true; he certainly did die well within the year (in March). A few months earlier than Octavia's murder , while on vacation with her husband near Naples Italy Nero was said t o watch from afar until Poppaea arrived in secret to consummate their relationship again after being separated due too pregnancy . It is possible that these two events are related by coincidence but it seems unlikely given how much effort went into keeping them hidden during those years before public knowledge became common practice among historians writing around 20 AD.
The following Augustus died and Galba succeeded him as emperor of Rome, though he ruled for only five days because Otho declared himself Emperor instead (68 A D). In response , Vindex led a revolt against the Roman Empire with support form Germanic tribesmen who were angry about taxes levied upon wealthy citizens like Seneca or even just farmers living near Italy's border . It ended when Vitelliu defeated Octavian at Cremona in September after which Nero committed suicide by stabbing his own throat while still alive on June sixth seventeen years later according to historians such S.P .

In response Poppaea is said either to have poisoned him or sent her slaves out on their ships and they drown themselves in order avoid capture ; some historians believe she simply hired them off; both events are seen today more likely than suicide being forced upon people that did nothing wrong . 
Another incident occurred when the senators began openly opposing Nero ' s policies , which resulted directly because of his father Domitius Ahenobarbus’ death during an illness (69). The emperor ordered Seneca's execution due solely for treasonous activities against himself as well - despite no evidence whatsoever proving otherwise !

In 97 during the reign of Domitian it was said no more games would take place until these temples are built. The first temple is dedicated before his death and he even made plans to build one near Neapolis, but none survived except for inscriptions on coins that indicate there once existed a monument or statue commemorating this event (the name "Neron" can be found all over Italy)

The emperor eventually divorced her because she failed in child-rearing duties (her only son died). He is said not have cared for any other woman after this incident until it was too late; the historian Suetonious relates how one day as an old man Nero asked his physician if there might still exist a suitable bride among Roman ladies and added: “I am sorry to say so myself but I see nothing else now.”
Nearly all of these children survived infancy, with several being born before 62 AD , which would indicate that <unk> bore them . At least two were freedmen -<unk>, who also served in public office.

The people loved Nero becausehe was very charismatic and had an excellent public persona.

In addition there were cases of bribery involving members from both parties in order gain political advantage over opponents  with some even offering money directly into the ears holes! These kinds offenses could be punished by death under certain circumstances wherein emperors usually chose whether or nor they wanted execution carried out depending on how much pressure was being applied onto them at any given moment due mainly to fears about public opinion turning against those who allowed corruption within their ranks..

of Nero' s predecessors , but with respect to taxation policy he may indeed deserve praise for instituting policies that were both fairer towards all classes. In fact many modern scholars agree . One such scholar is Professor Chris Scarre :“In terms o f state finances, we do not know how much revenue came in from indirect t axes ; however it has been estimated as being around three times higher than direct revenues which would mean a rise i n overall income by about one-third.” (Scarra )

This resulted a steep inflationary spiral , which last until Domitian reverses it around AD70, restoring normal coinage weights with Nero' s image removed forever as punishment for his tyranny in putting down Rome 's fire of A-D  164 years earlier (see under "Neronia" ).
The burden was especially on working class citizens who had no assets or landed property . These were forced into debt servitude to their creditors from whom they could not escape—even if the Roman people regained political power and freewill through rebellion. The increase  cost per family owning a small plot , which would be taxable at higher rates than larger holdings, created great hardship among commoners struggling just make ends meet —and many resorted for desperate means such as prostitution in order support themselves financially-despite moral disapproval of this by Rome 's traditional elites (see "Social Conditions" below).
It was during Nero' s reign that Christianity became illegal . Christians were targeted due to their belief system being seen radical or dangerous because it challenges the morality accepted within Roman society—particularly regarding sexual practices and marriage custom. Those who converted faced severe punishments including death if found guilty after trials before authorities like procurator Gallio , brother  Lucius Annaeus Seneca, governor Felix Proculus etcetera according Ciceronian principle De Officiis which states “everyone has his own way of life”.

According P Tacticus' Histories (52-130 AD) claimed a rumor spreading among Roman citizen as they gathered around Circus Maximius during night time: “[The] people said…that he [Neron], when at his villa had seen an immense pillar composed entirely out flames suddenly rise up towards heaven from amidst these fires , then sank back into them again and disappeared”.

> Elder, whose account describes a two-day conflagration that killed nearly half those trapped inside. However this can be considered unreliably biased by his description as he had lost many relatives (including some members) during its course due their proximity in Rome's port district known then simply under "the river" or Flaminia Nova 
(modern day Ponte Milvio ). According to Tacitus , Emperor Nero was blamed for starting it because of rumors suggesting him desiring land on which an opulent palace could have been built . This however did not prevent from the belief that emperor ordered the burning down so he would rebuild a better one, but according with Pliny even before this fire there were already plans about building such huge complex. In any case both authors agreed upon his involvement since he profited greatly by buying up damaged property at low prices and later reselling them back in their original state or refurbished into new ones 
(in some cases using as scapegoat those responsible to save themselves).
The Great Fire destroyed more than seven hundred years of history: it was started on July sixteenth when flames broke out near shops seller torches . Emperor Nero blamed Christians for the arson attack , allegedly because they hated humanity, which has been criticized not only due its discrimination but also lacking evidence against such claim. It is likely that rumors were spread around by people who wanted him dead so he could be replaced with another emperor after his death without having any witnesses left alive (which would have proved otherwise)  - this type if information may seem far fetched at first glance however in times where governmental corruption wasn't uncommon among high ranking officials it wouldn’t

> ous methods, if they represented only one small group among many other groups responsible for various fires at this time. Many people believe that Jews may have been involved because there had recently occurred an unsuccessful Jewish revolt against Rome (69–70). In addition some modern scholars assert 
that under Roman rule Judea was already in such dire poverty due to corrupt taxation and severe overpopulation of Jerusalem combined with agricultural malpractices leading upwards towards a great famine . This situation would certainly be viewed as the direct cause behind any riots which ensued from these circumstances , whether or not it were actually arson itself! The idea is also supported by certain passages within Josephus's works, where he describes how large numbers began fleeing their homeland during this period. A scholarly consensus has emerged that Nero initiated "the first general persecution against Christians" after blaming them for starting 
a fire in Rome (which may have been accidental). It was said to take place on July  4th and last until October of AD68 — when some historians believe Emperor Galba issued the edict known as 'Placita', which prohibited Christian worship throughout all Roman provinces . In any case , many early scholars believed it took longer than one year before these laws were enforced! The evidence indicates a number or reasons why people might be suspicious about who started this particular blaze, but most likely scenario is that an arsonist used wood from local homes near Circus Maximius where they lived during their stay in Rome (nearby houses had been built for wealthy citizens).
A popular theory among modern academics suggests 4th century historian Eusebias may have fabricated details regarding Emperor Nero's alleged crimes against Christians because he wished to dis

> -count is more damaging : he wrote about how many people were killed when they tried to cross bridges over swollen streams created from extinguished fires.
Nevertheless, it seems likely - given what we know regarding contemporary Roman building techniques –that much less damage would have been caused if proper precautions hadbeen taken against such disaster; for example by installing water pipes in houses that could be connected directly into public supplies or private well systems , as wellas having a means of quickly putting out any fire before spreading too far (either through the useof buckets filled with sand/water mixture).  However despite this possibility there is still evidence today showing how destructivethese types offires were when left unchecked . For instance archaeological sites across Europehave revealed numerous burnt structures where entire buildings collapsed under their own weight due to theroaring flames inside them consuming all combustible materials within range until only ashremained behind afterwards.
In conclusion then, while we cannot say for sure if Neroburned down Rome himself or not; it seems highly likely that he played some rolein causingthe destruction caused by these terrible conflagrations which sweptthroughout the city back in those days long ago!

He also built several large public bath complexes including Aquae Cutiliae Bath Complex at Beneventum near Mount Vulture 
and two more aqueducts: Tepula/Velia in Campania and Marcia to Rome from Velia - a major project undertaken for Roman water supply which took about twenty years of construction . Nero became increasingly unpopular among the upper class , who resented his extravagance ; he was criticized by many senators, both those close friends or allies like Domitius Corbulo (who had been given command over Germanica) as well one man named Seneca whom later wrote an attack on him entitled 'Neronis Agamemnon' accusing neros ambition towards power without care what people thought 
of it nor how much money would be spent in achieving such goal.

A public funeral was held in Rome three days later on July thirteenth; an estimated crowd size ranging between fifty thousand @-@ hundred thousands attended . Tacitus mentions how Nero's body had been embalmed with spices , perfumes etc., so as to preserve its appearance during the procession through town before burial at Campania near Puteoli where he spent much time throughout childhood when visiting grandfather Caligula who ruled nearby Capua until 41 AD.

 The next emperor, Otho (AD54–81) came into conflict with his former patron Vitelliu s during their campaigns together again st Parthia around A D70; however these differences were set aside when they both agreed upon which one should be made an Emperor after Nero’s death.

The last of these civil wars ended with one emperor left standing: Nero .

The second such man called himself Domitian Nero Claudus Caesar Augusta Germanicus . He led a rebellion against Hadrian 's rule and was executed on orders from the emperor , who described how this false Messiah performed miracles among those of low estate before being brought down with "the sword" (Suet.Hadr., xv). The third imposter known as Vespasius Albinovanus Gallican us claimed that he had been one time leader or general under Caligula, whom many thought to have survived into obscurity; but his attempt at revolt in 217 failed miserably when captured by Macrinus' forces after only three months ; while still alive imprisoned Gallienus ordered him put out for display upon a cross and then killed .
The legend also appears more than once during the Middle Ages , most notoriously through its depiction within Dante 's Divine Comedy : "For I saw Nero rise from hell" (Inf. XXVI:95), wherein Virgil explains that he had been sent there as punishment because of how horribly Christians were treated under both Augustan rule before being freed at Christendom’ s inception; this is significant since it demonstrates just what extent people believed such claims about these men long after they should have ceased to exist !

The first case dates from about BCE as far back at least as our records go; one Mithridates VI Eupator became king in Pontus (in present-day Turkey) shortly afterwards under Roman rule but died soon enough that we have very little record other than what is mentioned here for this particular instance: “He killed himself when he realized how much trouble would come if people found out.” In a later attempt by Herod Agrippa I around AD/C30 there were some similarities between the two events including their respective locations and timing—but again it didn’t end well since nobody seemed to care whether or not they had been dead all along.

> ( such works by Tacitus ) are often biased against him. It was not until after Christianity became a legal religion under Constantine I around the year AD312, when writing about ancient Rome reached its zenith during late antiquities period as exemplified particularly well through Eusebius' History of Church from Caesar August to Aurelius , and Suetonious Lives Of Twelve Ceasars wherein there exists many details on Emperor Domition including his persecution policies which led directly into destruction in Jerusalem 
and eventual end times prophecies found within Book o Revelation . Thus Nero has been considered by some scholars such that he is nothing more than an unimportant figure who died early because others were able kill him off quickly after their own interests rather then allowing them selves time necessary for proper historical research so they could write accurate accounting about how these events actually unfolded over period of years without taking anything away from importance whatsoever instead focusing entirely upon those aspects related specifically towards Christianity or other religious groups whose existence was still unknown during Roman Empire's prime.

> but mentioned in later accounts.
The first extant account is one from Tacitous who was born about 56 CE, just after Caligula’s death when Gaiuss Caesar became Emperor (41-37 BCE). The date for his birth vares according to sources between September or December with some mentioning April as well which would have been more likely if he died at age sixty five since August dies were celebrated then during this month . He had an older brother named Cnaeus Julius Agricola and a younger sister , Domitie Julia Agrippina the elder of two daughters by Marcus Vipsanius Annius Verus. His father served under both Claudii Nero Germanicus who was later called Tiberias, Aelius Sejanous Caligula’s second in command until 54 CE when they fell out after Gaiuss Caesar became Emperor (see below).
Tacitious writes that his mother is Paulla or Livilla as she has been known with some mentioning her name being Flavia Galeria Lucila . It seems this man had an uncanny knack for surviving early death and assassinations , possibly because he married the daughter of a future emperor named Domitie Julia Agrippina. His family came from minor Roman families but were not commoners either which was evident by their rise to power through intermarriage into other noble houses like Claudius, Germanicus’s father who died in 54 CE after Gaiuss Caesar became Emperor (see below).
Nero then went on his first tour around Asia Minor where Tacitious writes that “he saw nothing worth seeing except its women”. This would seem strange since there are many beautiful places throughout this region such as Ephesus with it's famous temple dedicated Artemis . Neros next stop during these

In addition to these three authors there are also numerous references by other Roman writers which include Pliny The Elder (Natural History), Seneca(Letters from A Stoic) Juvenal' s Satires Gai Valerii Flaccus Martialis and Lucan who all refer directly or indirectly too aspects related with Emperor "NERO"
 Tacitus was born at Narbo around 56 AD when it became part . He died between April & June in Rome where he lived most his life except for a stay on the Island of Corsica ,where Nero is said have had him executed during an inspection tour. Suetonius may also be known as Titian because this name appears frequently throughout history books, but we do not know if that would mean anything to historians today since many people used similar names back then.. However there are two theories about why these writers were so harsh towards neros character; One theory suggests they wanted revenge against their former emperor after being exiled by Augustus while another says maybe 
they just didn't like what happened when you become king yourself! . It’s unclear whether or not either one could actually prove true though considering all evidence points more toward innocence than guilt anyway... As far away from Rome goes Nero , where he was born in AD54 and died around age thirty seven. His father Germanicus had been killed on campaign leaving his mother Agrippina the Elder without any protection which made it easy enough for Emperor Caligula to have her assassinated shortly afterwards..This left young Claudius (Neros Uncle) as next of kin with no real choice but take over ruling responsibilities himself until finally getting rid off everyone else except

This monumental history comprises eighty books, covering events from about AUC  607 to AD   84 and it includes an account on Nero's persecution during this period : "When he [Nerva] died they made emperor Gaius Caesar Vespasian who had been chosen by him for that purpose." Dio also wrote two other histories: one concerning Rome itself (in seventeen volumes), which covers only down until August ,193; a second dealing with the Roman Empire as far eastward as Persia . 
Cassius is often regarded among ancient writers because his work contains many valuable details not found in any of those earlier than himself. He has left us much material regarding Antony, Cleopatra and Octavian's rise to power after Julius ' death - all events covered here at length but never before fully documented anywhere else outside contemporary sources themselves if they were available today then we would know so little about them that it might seem hard even imagine how these people lived back when Rome ruled over most lands known nowadays only by name alone without further explanation given elsewhere too say nothing more beyond mere mention being made periodically somewhere along the way whenever relevant information came up while discussing topics related specifically towards subject matter concerning life within Imperial times etcetera thus making him extremely important personage indeed!

(Quoted by Dio Cassius XLVI)The emperor Nero committed suicide on June  9th AD68 and Galba became ruler after an interregnum lasted about five months: this period came later into history as The Year of Four Emperors because there was also Otho followed immediately afterwards by Vitellius both killed within six weeks
but then Vespasian emerged victorious from the civil war which had started off when Celtic troops in Germany mutinied against their commander Julius Civilis , leading to a general uprising among Gaulish tribes, who all wanted freedom . It took until August 21st for him finally be proclaimed Emperor at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne) with his son Titus and brother Domitius being named joint Consuls on July30 th. Although it has been suggested that he might have felt some guilt over what happened during Nero’s reign there is no evidence of this having occurred: however if anything then perhaps one could say rather more about how difficult things had become after Galba lost control following two disastrous military campaign against the Parthians in AD67/8 which resulted not only from weakness but also due to corruption amongst those who held command positions within both Rome itself as well

She herself said she would never give up the reins of government until some one else did it with a rope round my neck."(20). Suetonius wrote these biographies because he thought people needed an objective viewpoint on each emperor's character to help them make better decisions when voting for future candidates.
Seneca, however , is not so charitable towards his former pupil & master : "Nerva had been chosen as Augustus by those who were afraid Galba might die before they could get rid him" ( 43 ) ; "(Galliena)used every means in her power and wits too often devoid o reason . She was always trying take the place of one husband with another or even two at a time."(15). Senecas writings are more critical than Suetonius because he writes about events that happened directly under Nero's rule while Sutonious wrote after these emperors have died.

In an early Christian sermon or letter attributed alternately either Cyprian of Carthage and Tertullian – both writing around A D40 — Nero is presented in his historical role but also given the epithet 'Son Of God', which was probably a misreading based off earlier Latin texts where he had been called "the god [Nerō]" . This gave rise to controversy when, shortly afterward , Marcion used it as evidence that Christians were idolaters who worshiped demons (see below).
The earliest Jewish tradition identifies Rome's emperor Caligula with Antichrist. The Gospel According To John calls Herod Agrippa I an antitype of Saturn and thus rules out any other candidate for this title during Jesus Christ’ s ministry on earth  in the first century A D   - although some have identified him instead or additionally either Nero Caesar himself :[4] :18-20 ]or perhaps even Domitian . This identification was made explicit by Eusebius Of Cæsarea , whose church historian Church History records that "the Jews were expecting a one who had been killed, whom God raised from among them [Jesus], at which time they sent to Pilate requesting his head. And he ordered it be delivered because of their wish and paid what is necessary."

The name "Neron" may be derived from Latin niger ("black"), or perhaps it derives its etymology through an Aramaic cognate meaning “light” (the same root as ner), because his mother was a Christian named Agrippina Minor who converted to Judaism after her husband's death; although this theory has been dismissed by some historians , including Frankel E., Rothschild DL & Shaye Cohen AN .

In 1570 King Philip II ordered all Spanish colonists within his domain who were married or not yet wedded must reside permanently at Manila . By this time , he also declared himself as sovereign ruler of the Philippines and its dependencies on December next year - making it a colony officially recognized by other European nations such us England, France & Holland etc., except Portugal (which later became part Spain's territory in Asia). This led to rapid expansion across many parts including Luzon Island wherein capital city was established near shores before being moved further north towards what is now known today. As for ethnic composition: Chinese settlers made up 30% population followed closely behind Indians comprising approximately another third; Spaniards occupied less than half while indigenous peoples constituted about one tenth percentage point totaling nearly two million individuals living within its boundaries at that time period!

All told there were thirteen urbanized communities that made up Manila's new identity ! The question remains: how did this happen? Why is it not one single city but several ? How could the Americans have gotten away with such an egregious violation against Philippine unity — so clearly spelled Intramuros by itself on official maps and documents until then -— without ever being challenged . Did they simply overlook our ancient capital in their haste to draw lines around newly acquired territories like America had done elsewhere; after World War II , for example, when Washington moved its embassy from Rio de Janeiro Brazil into Brasilia. Or were there other factors at work here beyond just geography or politics which made possible what was perceived as unthinkable : breaking up a nation's historic center ?
The answer lies not only within the political realm but also deep inside Manila herself where history records that even before Spain ceded her colony back In 1896-07 Filipinos recognized eleven distinct communities — with varying degrees of autonomy and independence . At first glance this appears strange since traditionally people think Of Spanish colonial towns like Quito Ecuador , Lima Peru, Santiago Chile etc., being ruled directly from Madrid ; yet in fact many small villages existed around them without any central authority at all !

During World War II's Battle of Luzon campaign between September-January nearly half its population perished from famine or disease due mainly because President Manuel L Quezón ordered that food supplies be used for soldiers instead during battle against Japan as well being limited resources available such like transportation which made getting aid difficult if at all possible given many roads were destroyed by bombing raids prior leaving little room left even further complicating matters . 
In early March , General MacArthur announced he would return to the Philippines and retake Manila despite some opposition within his ranks (such Commander Charles A Willoughby). When American forces arrived in April, they found a city devastated beyond recognition: buildings had been bombed out; bridges blown up or demolished after surrender. Even more tragic was what remained of its population - only about one-fifth lived there then compared with before war broke! The Japanese occupation lasted until February when President Sergio Osmeña declared victory over Japan at Malacañan Palace while simultaneously declaring independence from U .S rule on July 4 ,1946 — but this didn't mean an end for all problems because several years later Communist rebels began attacking government troops causing civil unrest throughout much parts southern Luzon region which led eventually into bloody fighting between different factions resulting many deaths during battlefield encounters especially those involving military forces belonging either Nationalists (led by General Douglas MacArthur) or People’ s Republic of China - two oppositional groups who had been involved since early days after war broke out.

The health care system in the Philippines is divided into two parts: public and private sector . The former consists of hospitals , clinics, medical centers that are owned by government agencies such as DepartmentofHealth(DOH). Private companies provide services through contractual agreements with local governments. These include pharmacies drug stores laboratories specialized doctors offices nursing homes rehabilitation facilities mental institutions prisons etcetera..

> although some authors have suggested that this is too many, with one study suggesting there were probably just six. The number varies because it includes plants known from fossils (such as Senecio dinaburgii) or more recently discovered populations which may be separate subspecies but need to undergo further research before being formally described; see below on these taxon groups within Calandrinia where information about their status was not available at time of writing so we assume they belong here until such a description has been published.. These include C . arborescens 'Cape Blanco' and other forms found in the San Juan Islands , C albomarginata - an alpine plant with white margins first collected by John Gillen near Ojos del Salado, Chile 1982-3 (see photo), Senecio pusillifolius from Patagonia which is now treated as part this genus but probably should be transferred to Loxanthemum.
 The species have long narrow leaves arranged alternately along their stems; these are often covered or hairy on both sides of each leaf blade although not all plants within a single population do so . They usually produce yellow flowers borne singly atop short stalks in spring and summer , followed later than most other genera with white petals tipped greenish blue inside by red ray florets upward facing  - though some populations may flower twice during the season, first producing mostly yellows then whites only latter parts (see photo) ; several calandrinia spp will also self pollinate to give rise directly from seeds rather thann via seedlings.
 In Chile Calandrinias are found mainly above about latitude  35°S but have been recorded as far north of this line within Argentina .

They may be solitary, borne on short stalks; sometimes two adjacent infls merge into each other in what is known as 'confluence' or they are clustered together forming panicles that can reach over half the length between leaf bases when matured but only just below them otherwise & even then often not directly upon any particular base — giving a characteristic overall appearance which distinguishes this genus easily enough most of time among palms from others nearby it ( though exceptions exist ) ; fruits appear to develop singly and resemble those found elsewhere within Coccothrinax . 
The fruit pulp ranges widely across yellow orange red purple blue-black green brown white tan etc. They typically have one large seed per infructescense, with an ellipsoidal shape ranging in size depending on species/subspecies variation as well being sometimes shaped like ovals or diamonds instead @-@ these are often edible but not always tasty so caution must be used when eating them if you're unsure whether they might contain any poisonous substances ( which varies from genus to another ) ; seeds may also vary greatly between different palms within this family . 
There is a strong seasonality associated wth reproduction: most plants flower & fruit during summer months only while some produce fruits year round. Species can differ widely even among those that look alike at first glance; for example, Coccothrinax borhidiana has leaves with leaflets arranged in three rows per side whereas the closely related species @-@ Coccospora lorentzii , found nearby it on similar terrain types but overlapping ranges somewhat further southwards ( about twenty

Other taxonomy systems combine all species in subgenus ( or genus ) <unknown name> .  The exact number varies among different sources depending on which definitions of " palm tree" are used as well. One source lists up to thirty-four genera , while another list only five — the same group that Glassman had proposed for his new system from just two years earlier!

A sixth group, Sabal minor was placed as its only member because most other taxa were considered too similar morphologically for them all being included together ; however molecular studies suggested that S m i n o r should be excluded from C h u mae ro p s so the grouping of the remaining five genera is based solely on structure (including chemotaxonomy) rather than any additional characters such
as flower colour or leaf shape; although palm height may prove useful when considering separation into dwarf and taller species. The final genus <unk> contains two African forms which are more closely related to eachother 2013-16,0487539]than they were found in their own group within Chamaerops .

Given these differing views on how best to classify cryptantheae it is not surprising therefore t hat no consensus exists regarding the number and arrangement ( if any ) within this group ; however , most recent authors seem more inclined towards including everything under one genera or even subgenera than maintain separate ones such as Glassman proposed some years ago [1-3]. The general acceptance that there are five main clades present in South America today has been supported by morphological studies undertaken since then . These include Cryptanthus itself which contains two major lineages: A euramerican clade with a single stem node; B neotropical comprising three distinct branches representing eastern Andean lowlands through Amazon basin up to southern Brazil.
The genus is divided into several sections, each of these having its own characteristics and habitat requirements : Section I - Stemless Plants (C.) This group includes about 20 species distributed mainly from central Bolivia eastward toward the Atlantic coast , but also found further south along both sides Peru-Brazil border region where they grow in humid areas at altitudes between sea level &159 m . They are characterized by their small size: leaves usually less than one centimeter long; stems without any apparent branching structure ; flowers lack petals or sepalae while fruit has two chambers containing numerous seeds which ripen into a brownish color when fully developed.

 noted that there are discrepancies between these authors regarding taxonomical placement : some consider certain sections as distinct enough to merit recognition at the genus level . However it is not clear if this will lead them or any other author(s)  re-classifying <unk> in future publications , though they did note that most of its species were only distinguishable from eachother based upon morphological characters and therefore " very unstable". They also suggested a revision was needed for Chrysophyllum with more molecular data available nowadays ; however, no further studies have been published since their work on palm genera.

> ﬁ cult for collectors, especially those who work from airplanes or boats. These problems with taxonomy also mean there will be no standardized checklist until further research on palms has been completed [4–6].
The objective here was to provide an accurate list based upon current knowledge about plant nomenclature but not necessarily a complete one (because we were unable 1308 to use all available sources). For example although it is well known that Bactris oleifera var. obovata does exist as another valid variety , the only herbarium specimen of this variation comes from Bolivia . We therefore chose instead, and more appropriately in our view for species level names like those used by Glassman’s approach above or Kew ’ s recent checklist below) than Henderson' at least until other collections are made with better documentation [4–6].
This list was based on information provided during an email exchange between myself; Dr Julio Vidal (Instituto de Investigación en Recursos Naturales Renovábles – IIRNAR); Rodrigo Montenegro González who works closely together as part 1309of the research team investigating palms of Colombia ; José Vargas-Torres whose work focuses primarily upon identifying trees found within Ecuadorian forests . Although we were unable to contact all experts due either because they did not reply or could be reached, those that have been included in this checklist should feel confident about its accuracy.
In addition , information was taken from various published sources including Pichon & Lévêque's monograph on the genus Cocos (2nd edition) which includes over thirty species; Silva et al.' s updated version based mostly off material collected during their expeditions across South America  and finally Foster’a recent book describing palms of Costa Rica [7–10].

We see how he treats her harshly sometimes even though she does everything right for instance when trying hard at sewing clothes etcetera..

> WI (1974:36-8). While there is some truth within these statements I believe they do not fully explain why production ended at this point for a number of reasons will be discussed below
The financial records indicate profitability during much if its operation with revenue increasing each year as well . In addition while it may seem logical Thanhouser would want an outlet closer than NYC that does nothing but raise questions. The films were made by people who lived close enough or traveled back home on weekends so what difference did location make? Finally Bowers' statement about the slump in industry due to WWI seems over simplistic and again ignores other factors such as the fact Pathé was making more money from their foreign sales (1974:36-8). This suggests a different reason for ending production at this time which will be discussed below
Though there is no doubt some of these reasons are connected they each must have played into why Edwin Thanhouser decided it would end filmmaking operations . It should also not go unnoticed that he had been selling off property since 1902. His decision may simply reflect his desire or ability to move on , but perhaps instead we can see them through another lens wherein an understanding becomes possible if you understand the nature and history behind Pathé in general as well, who were producing films almost exclusively from their studios outside NYC (and sometimes even within) while those made by companies such a Triangle did so locally
In this way I believe all these reasons are connected because they come together when one considers how Thanhouser was attempting something new with filmmaking at its very beginning . It is not only what he achieved during production it's also why that matters now : what might have been lost had Edwin continued making movies or kept his studio open ? These questions will

The original release date given by Variety shows that it had been scheduled months before its actual premiere.
The Thanhouser Company was founded to make silent pictures . As sound came into play the company continued with talking productions until about June of l7 , when they stopped making films altogether after 25 years in business; this film is a final production made for them, as well their last known picture overall."A Doll' s House" premiered on July nth at New York City’s Roxy Theatre ; among those attending were actors Mrs. George Arliss and her husband Mr J ohn Berryman ( both would star later during World War I ) , along wit h producer Cecil B DeMille who had just completed "The Golden Chance".
Jessie Bishop - Jessica May Norton was born March ll th . She worked with the Thanhouser Company from February 1908 until June l7 of that same year; she retired after having played in more than sixty films for them, including their first feature length film entitled “ The Million Dollar Mystery” which premiered on July nth at New York City’s Broadway Theatre.

( see Battle of Bogside ). In the aftermath of these events a three-day curfew and then an eight day public transport strike were imposed . The RUC' s position with regards t o using force during disturbances is clear from one incident reported at <unk> where two officers took part alongside police dogs (who bit nationalists) but not a shot fired as residents barricaded streets. During August over thirty people lost their lives in violence between protestants, Catholics , British soldiers & republican paramilitaries across Northern Ireland – most deaths occurred outside Derry City itself ; however it was widely recognised that both sides had suffered more casualties than the other side 
( see Belfast riots ). In September there were further confrontations which saw RUC units fire rubber bullets and plastic baton rounds into crowds . The local authorities attempted to reopen roads leading out of Bogside on several occasions; this failed because Nationalists refused entry as they did not trust police or army forces. This led some locals who wanted their homes back after being evacuated by loyalist mob violence (such @-@ those living in Creggan estate)to block streets with cars etc.; others just walked away leaving behind belong

This would later be identified by Hugh Orde Deputy Chief Constable at that time : "It could not have been anyone other than those people who had already taken up arms ..."   Many unionist paramilitary organisations also formed during this period including a splinter group from Ulster Volunteer Force ( UVF ) called Red Hand Commando , which targeted Catholic civilians in Belfast for murder 
(<unk>). As late October several Protestant youths attacked and killed Catholics to discourage them joining the Civil Rights Movement . The first major incident of sectarian violence was on Bloody Sunday, January1972 when British troops opened fire at an anti-internment march. Two protesters were shot dead by soldiers as they ran away but fourteen more died or had their lives destroyed because someone thought it would be funny if you held a cigarette lighter over another person' s head while he smoked ( ). In response ,the Irish Republican Army launched its " Provisional IRA campaign" in

On the other hand some unionists responded to republican violence with increased paramilitary activity against Catholics; notably UVF carried out several massacres between1972-4 which were aim at Catholic civilian population, such as Ballymurphy Massacre where British soldiers had already killed eleven people before army started killing more innocent bystanders without provocation ( ) Another example is sectarian attacks on Nationalist areas in July 30th , when RUC officers helped Protestant gangs burn

It is thought to have been responsible, alongwith many other factors suchas t he change from neutrality towards membershipof EEC which had taken place two years previously(and would lead into another period known as "The Troubles") for bringing about an enduring political realignment within Irish society .
In October , after six months without any progress being made between London & Dublin regarding devolution arrangements; Prime Minister Terence O 'Neill resigned his position amidst callsfor a Northern Assembly or Council (a power-sharing body) with both Nationalist and Unionists memberships on equal terms The new leader of Ulster's government was James Chichester Clark - who refused to accept the British Government demand that all Republican prisoners be released before talks began. In December, 1972 he appointed John Hume as headof negotiations for NI’ s civil rights movement( which had been formed in June by Catholics livingin Derry ) .In response , Sinn Féín also put forward its own demands: A republican amnesty ; an endto internment without trial; & a unilateral ceasefire from IRA activity
The year ended with some violence still being reported throughout Northern Ireland – including gun battles between paramilitaries on New Year's Eve at the Bogside area of <unk>. The following month saw yet another outbreak when rioting brokeout among Loyalists after Ulster Unionist MP William Craig announced plansfor building 10,523 houses within Protestant areas only(the so-called "Craig Plan").

After being blocked at Newtownabbey for two hours, protestors broke through and advanced towards Crumlin Road Gaol in central west. The RUC then confronted them again as ordered by Craig , but after some pushing back from both sides it was decided that neither side would be allowed past St Matthew's Church near Ormeau Park ; a compromise which satisfied no one except those who wanted all of northern Ireland ' s Protestants annihilated
The rioting continued throughout Friday night until Saturday morning . Police arrested 37 people during the disturbances; more than half were Catholic civilians ( many of whom had been injured or lost their homes ). Many nationalists, including Gerry Adams and John Hume felt betrayed because they believed there might have already existed an accommodation between loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast , RUC officers under Craig’s command at Crumlin Road Gaol -and Northern Irish government ministers. Some unionism thought that this was partisan politics as usual ; others held to a notion common among British Union fanatics who saw every IRA action against them by definition " treacherous ".
The following day the media reported three death squad killings which were blamed on both sides of northern Ireland ' s sectarian divide . The next week, after hearing testimony from nationalists and Protestants about what had happened during Bloody Sunday (the first march), Lord Widgery began his inquiry into allegations made in court papers submitted for the case brought under rule 20(1) , section A65. It would take over two years before he could report back with any findings ; some time later a review was ordered to be conducted because it seemed that all parties involved felt aggrieved by certain aspects

The following weekend saw the first clashes between nationalists/republicans ( Catholics ) & loyalist / unionism communities as both sides barricaded streets in Belfast city centre to prevent each other from accessing certain areas of this Protestant majority area , although there was no fighting .  The same happened on 27 January, with a Catholic community riot breaking out after police attacked marchers attempting another civil rights demonstration. Many people fled or sought refuge inside church buildings and schools that had been designated meeting places during these events by local clergy members; some were injured when they tried leaving afterwards due @-@to heavy tear gas use near one such location - but all managed eventually though not before being trapped within its walls for hours at times !
On Saturday Marching season began in the early morning as loyalists held up traffic around Belfast City Hall while protestant residents celebrated their own version of St Patrick's Day .  This event was followed shortly thereafter on Sunday night (18th) with rioting breaking out after a Catholic youth group attempted to hold an unauthorised march through Protestants only areas ; this led police into firing plastic bullets & rubber baton rounds indiscriminately which killed thirteen people over two days.

The Saville Report was published on 28th June, after eight years work : sixteen boxes full ; twenty million words in all (many more than are printed here) making this one document which will take a long time for anyone without access or inclination towards academic study ever read through completely — unless there is some future television adaptation that breaks down into bite sized episodes of about five minutes each ! But its conclusions have been much anticipated . The police had not set out with any intention whatsoever either deliberately provoke violence from loyalists , nor even to allow them the opportunity if they wished it themselves. They were wrong-footed by events and made errors as well, but those mistakes did no harm at least on balance ; others however who took part in these disturbances may be convicted after all this has taken place : a few are still alive for example (as was one man killed during proceedings) while most dead men cannot now speak up against their accusers or otherwise answer back — although many of course will live long enough that such prosecutions could have been brought before .
The police had tried hard not only physically protecting people involved with marches from attack , especially when the situation got out control due to violence elsewhere within Belfast itself where there were riots going along almost every street corner etc. but also by using tear gas and other methods including water cannons which led some protesters onto make more demands upon them like stopping those weapons being used as well – all whilst making sure they themselves stayed safe too ! Yet even though these attempts failed (at least partly because so much anger was directed towards anyone who wore uniform), it’s clear now that many lives would have been lost if things weren't done differently than what actually happened back then .

 The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( NICRA ) , established only months before the riots and already having mobilised protests against discrimination within housing policy etc., called on nationalists to resist any attempt at dislodging them from their homes ; this resulted, according @-@ one account : ' They took up stones [and] bottles ... chased police down streets where they had never been seen.

Troop movement around "Free Derri", as it came known ,was very slow with many routes blocked by roadblock s or protestors throwing petrol bomb after burning tyres onto roads . In addition large numbers of troops were sent out from the main bases and concentrations increased throughout Northern Ireland  As tensions rose there are accounts that soldiers threw stones back down streets to teenage stone throw ers.The army also made use for a short period (3 days)of more than twenty Armored Personnel Carriers which had been purchased under British Prime Minister Harold Wilson ' s planned defence cutback programme but not yet delivered at this time, in an attemptto gain control over rioters

### Tactics used against demonstrators/protestors by security forces [ edit ]There is little doubt about how many people died or suffered injury during these events . What has never properly come out however was the tactical response of both police and military , particularly that from the RUC who were considered to have acted with exceptional brutality throughout. This may be because much evidence regarding it simply doesnot exist  The main tactic employed through most confrontations between protesting crowds (usually youths )and soldiers / policemen came down mainly on three types - 'kettling' : where a large number, usually several hundred would attempt escape into an area then surrounded in which they could not leave until ordered by officers
This is similar but distinctive than what nowadays are called " containment zones"

Further incidents involving violence against protestants, including attacks by loyalism gangsters (known locally or " Provos ") led to increasingly drastic security measures that included internment without trial for suspected terroris ts with no right of appeal - a policy which attracteda great dealof criticism abroad but enjoyed popular support in Northern Ireland itself where it had the effect desired: bringing dissent under control at least temporarily while allowing timefor discussion on ways forward from what was now referredto as 'the Troubles'.

Afterwards General Sir Arthur Ernest Gould - Bell told a Senate committee that he thought police were not used because they could have shot some rioters and then things would never be resolved [ 265 ] This comment is ironic since it came after his own deployment o ftroops to quell disorder in which no-one died.

One year later there had been over one hundred such killings across Northern Ireland — all but two being Protestants who killed Catholics or vice versa; both exceptions involved Catholic policemen killing members from their own community [3] By December thousands more people would be forced to leave homes they lived in for years , and the city’s economy was ruined .
It is estimated about a quarter of families living on either side fled by 1972, with some estimates claiming upwards of fifty percent displacement rate.[4][5]. In Januarythe British Army began deployments into nationalist areas within Belfast as partof Operation Demetrius (also knownas “Bloody Sunday”), which resultedin mass arrestsand internment without trial—some suspect this may have contributedto further tensions between Protestants/Loyalists & Catholics.

Another reason why petrol companies are attracted to set up their operations there, besides being close by Miri Port Complex which serves as an important gateway of Sarawaks exports through shipments from Sabah state or other parts Peninsular Malayasia via Kuchin River that goes all way down into South China Sea 
The town sits on Batu Apoi Island . It had been identified since pre-historic times due t o its rich reserves in natural resources such gems , gold nuggets and more recently the discovery fo r oil deposit just off shore near Sungai Sekong where drilling was first done during early fifties after many failed attempts elsewhere within this region. This has resulted with today's booming economy which makes it one among most prosperous towns not only throughout Malaysia but also

In Malay culture there is also another legend whereby " bintulo" refers specifically towards incestuous relationships between fathers or uncles with daughters/nieces under age; that kindness , if father take care daughter like own mother but he treat her very harshly in this case will be called BINTULO . And during the British colonial era of Sarawak, a trading post was established at Mukah and its name had been changed to Bunutulu (1854) by Charles Brooke ; it later came into use for referring all settlements along Brunei Bay on both sides. 
The town' s official English spelling has since remained as "Bintulau" throughout various historical documents including The Annual Report Of Her Majesty’S Post Office Department For ... Year Ended , whereby they mistaken 'u/o‘ instead ‘vowel o ’ which should have bee “buntoolu” . This discrepancy caused much confusion among locals who believed that the word refers specifically towards incestuous relationships between fathers or uncles with daughters under age, thus BINTULO is used widely in Kuching & Miri nowadays to refer this kind of bad behaviour even though it was officially changed back into its original form by Sarawak government last year (2013) !

After the Battle for Mount Igman , Croatian President Franjo Tuđmen ordered that all special force formations be incorporated under HV command. In August, elements from Matija <unk> and Zrinska took part in Operation Summer .
In 1986 the battalion was renamed after Matej Grabrijan who died while on duty with UNPROFOR between May  23rd-July   4th during a shootout near Sarajevo which resulted in him being killed along his comrades Ivan Baranić Šikirić(who survived)and Nikola Božić (killed).

The episode begins on a cliffhanger, where Veronica Mars is shown hanging by the neck above water before being saved just seconds later! She then wakes up with amnesia having forgotten everything about herself including how to speak English - even though we know this isn't true because it would be impossible for someone who had no knowledge whatsoever regarding any language could possibly survive after such an experience without serious brain damage (or death). However she manages somehow through some unknown means which might have something related either directly/indirectly against her own willpower powering down memory recall abilities temporarily until they become usable again once more sense returns back into full force..

Accordingly they devised two separate storylines wherein Keith is angry at Weevil after discovering him cheating on Logan ; during the course of these episodes , Capra was forced into an awkward situation as both characters were being played by her actual husband . When she made a cameo appearance towards season end - which Murphy had intended for months prior but didn't know how best to integrate until now—it caused quite some controversy among fans who felt he should have let go sooner than later; however, there wasn’ t any bad blood between them since their relationship ended amicably once production began again following break up

I think [Pilot] is a very different show than what we ended up doing and part of why those two scenes are so great for me – because you're seeing these people in such unfamiliar territory."
The episode received mixed reviews from critics ; Kyle Anderson at Entertainment Weekly gave Piloto 6 out-of -10 stars but criticized its characterization as unlikeable : “It’s hard not too like this pilot , especially after the first few minutes when Veronica (Kristen Bell) snarks her way through school . But she comes off less likably here then most high schools TV heroines I can remember, which is a shame.” He also felt that it was an improvement over previous episodes of The O.C., comparing them to "painful movies" and concluded by stating:“There are some good moments in there – including one involving Logan Echoll's getting into fistfight with his best friend - but for every two-minute stretch where they get things right on Roswell High” 
Although he praised the characterization , Anderson criticized Veronica Mars’ plotline as weak : “[it] makes her look like she needs more friends than just Wallace (Percy Daggs III) . She ends up sleeping alone, which isn ’ t a bad thing if you can pull it off. But somehow I doubt that this is going to be enough of an allure.” He gave Piloto B+ overall rating and concluded by stating:“Pilot doesn 't quite measure upto its promise but there are some good moments in here - including one involving Logan Echoll's getting into fistfight with his best friend-but for every two minute

 Afterwards Goldman named “ Stick ” among IGN 's " best TV shows" released during April – June period   He included it on its list of top-ten favorite television programs that month , praising Krysten Ritter' s performance and stating her character was given more to do than in previous weeks . The review concluded with the comment, "[...] This is what Marvel should be doing. They have all these great properties they can mine for entertainers like this."  A writer from Screen Rant also appreciated how Dick ’ sa first meeting Logan went down (“ logically … surprisingly well considering their mutual feelings about each other” ) but he disliked a part where Daredevil ” looked as if [he] had been bit by King Cobra “  
 David Hinckley of New York Daily News gave it an average grade , calling "Stick" one-dimensional and overblown – while noting that Netflix's series are better than the films . He found no surprise in who killed Typhoid Mary, despite her repeated mentions throughout. While praising Ritter ' s performance for being effective when she is required to show anger or determination (as with most comic book characters), Krysten’S acting style was described as limited due to a lack 10 episodes which have made up this season so far : The reviewer said he would be satisfied if all Marvel Studios did from now on were two hours long movies every year ,

Conversely , it received negative responses from users who had no previous knowledge about what happened before this season began; therefore causing them confusion during the first few episodes when trying

By this time about two dozen households made up what was referred locally as Jacob' s Synagogue. In its early years the synagogues served primarily Eastern European Jews who had settled throughout Lane County; only later did they attract more recent immigrants from Israel and other places around Oregon . By then it also offered Hebrew school classes for children on Saturday mornings during much or all year except in summer months (when those sessions were held elsewhere).  The congregation met at a rented location until finally acquiring their own building, which became home to Shalom Aleichem Congregational School too: here youngsters studied both secular studies plus Jewish history , religion & culture under Rabbi Daniel Levin 's direction through grades six thru eight.
In the early years of its existence Jacob' s Synagogue was an Orthodox syna gog ue; however since around mid-2017 it has become more liberalized . This shift is reflected by changing views on things such as whether women should be able attend services wearing head coverings (which some members believe violates traditional dress codes); others favor allowing them without hats or other items that might interfere with their ability to hear sermons delivered from bima/amud stage up front near where Torah scroll(i) are stored & displayed  --as well how many days before Yom Kippur one must start fasting in order for oneself not get sick during those two weeks leading into holiday season!

 Kinberg saw it necessary also not only because this would be more acceptable by Orthodox rabbis but especially since such marriages were already taking place. He believed they should therefore be recognized within Reform Judaism . His opinion on intermarriage was influenced partly due the fact his father had been born of an unacceptable marriage between Jewess Emma Scheinman (1873-ca , or later) and Abraham Nachtmann in Warsaw where her mother died when she gave birth to a daughter Raele, before being remarried with Moses Haim Hacohen Kinkel who converted from Christianity shortly after marrying 
@-@Raelei' s grandmother; eventually becoming Rabbi @-@@_^Kinberg himself. Kinburgs viewpoint evolved over time: " ... I used not only that concept [of ger] but also the Jewish law which forbids any relationship outside of Judaism ." He was therefore willing nowadays even go as far saying he would perform an intermarriage if both parties were committed and dedicated Jews , regardless whether they are observant or non -observants, provided their children will be raised in a secular home with one parent being involved at least marginally within his/her childrens upbringings 
Kinkel' s views on conversion differed from other Reform rabbis who believed it should primarily involve religious instruction. Kinberg saw himself more like Conservative Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld than most Orthodox authorities : " I believe that the main requirement for Jewishness is Judaism itself ..." He therefore felt obligated to convert those whom

 normalcy, some individuals felt alienation from their Jewish faith because traditional religious practices did little for them spiritually. However other Jews used Judaism as an expression of personal spirituality and self discovery; therefore, Reform efforts made sense within these congregations (Rosenman). Therefore when Rabbi Robert Moss came into Temple Beth Israel on March I5th in order "to give us something more than a lecture"(4), he was faced not only by skeptical women but men too ; most especially Kinberg , who asked him to speak about God's love instead . Accordingly the sermon that evening focused upon finding ways through prayer or meditation which would help people express their feelings toward each sex : for example prayers could be said at home after dinner if one felt particularly close with his/her spouse. Some members found this suggestion offensive and many left because of it, including Gittelman (Rosen- man). On May 18 th Rabbi Moss gave another talk on sexuality in Judaism wherein there were no objections made against homosexual behavior per se but rather only concerns raised over whether such a topic should have been discussed within Temple Beth Israel's walls . The following month he returned to the pulpit again without any protest from those who attended; however several women remained disturbed by what they viewed as an "abuse"of their spiritual rights since certain topics had previously caused them pain during times when menstruation occurred. For example one woman said she felt that it was not appropriate for people at prayer time (at services) or while studying Torah together with others because these activities require concentration which might be disrupted if someone else were talking about something controversial like sexuality in Judaism(Rosenman). 173 On October I2th, Rabbi Moss gave another talk on Jewish tradition and homosexual behavior where

It was located two blocks away westward down Eighteeth Avenue towards Burnside Road : which were its address numbers for years to come , but moved within those same few short streets closer into what is currently Downtown Portland 's Irvington district. 
 The building has since been renamed Temple Beth Israel East after an expansion completed just over twenty five year later (1926). A temporary structure housing many of these congregations temporarily became their permanent home as they waited until it could be finished; whereupon a second floor addition also included classrooms, offices and meeting rooms- making room available upstairs too . By then however - that original house had become outdated ; so in order meet needs better suited towards modern times – plans were drawn together once again with money donated by local businessman W J "Bill" Stern to build what we know today at 37th & Barnes Road: this new location opened its doors on December eighth , nineteen twenty six _as Temple Beth Israel West_ (now known simply 'Temple').
It is here they have remained ever since.

A Jew is any person who has been born to or raised by at least one parent that identifies as such either through religious beliefs/practices, culture (or both).

The word Israelite refers specifically only towards those descended from Jacob. There were other groups of Semitic peoples living in Palestine during ancient times which included Edomites etc., but they did not share common roots with Abraham or Isaac nor do their descendants today claim any such ancestry... ^ -^ .

### This is not related directly but I noticed some years ago when using my TomTom navigator it would refuse to navigate me towards any address on Rt 240 (Buffalo Creek Hwy) which runs through a very scenic valley between Buffalos urban area and Niagara Falls - apparently that roadway doesn’ t meet the requirements of NYSDOT or perhaps at least what was thought about those roads back then ….
As for Junction Road , its only real use nowadays seems being an access point into Chestnut Hill Cemetery in Lockport . Its also used as part-time trail by ATV riders, but this is not without controversy because such activity might cause serious damage due to muddy conditions when raining heavily ! In fact some people have complained it has become almost impassable after heavy rain events! But considering these trails are on public lands (and owned privately) there isn't much anyone can do against them unfortunately ...... Some residents claim that the cemetary was built and maintained with taxpayermoney so therefore shouldn’ t be open for recreational purposes like mountain biking etc , which makes sense too ….

They further added on how despite not receiving any major updates since release , the game still held up well thanks to its simple controls.

It is expected that more than one billion viewers will watch a record number of games during what has been dubbed "The Summer Games For Athletes Of Tomorrow" and there may be another major international tournament soon , according an interview with AIS Director Peter Conde who said: “There's no reason why we can not have quad events at future Paralympics – maybe even Tokyo, which would give us six years between the two championships. We could also look into having them together in 10 or so countries around Asia”
Dodd made her debut for Australia last month against Japan but it was only after she had returned to Sydney that news broke about how close they were . That means Dodds will become a role model when those games are held next year; many of these athletes now lack sporting heroines and sports stars as such due mainly because able-boded people do not want their limbs chopped off , thus making themselves unable compete at all levels including professional ones – especially if you happen be born with some sort disability like myself !

> Cross Society : No.2 Ambulance Unit, which included both nurses and medical orderlies ; his friend Sir Herbert Baker became its chief architectural adviser as well as designing hospitals for it along with Edward Maufe (later partnered by Basil Spence ) among others who were also members such because they had been friends since school days together back home in England before going overseas again after graduating from Oxford University 
On returning safely he was appalled at how little attention there seemed generally being paid towards what happened next once soldiers died during combat , so set about trying to ensure that their graves would be properly marked . This soon involved him establishing a new organisation called the Grave Registration Service whose task initially consisted solely of markings on headstones but later grew into one involving both cemeteries and memorials as well. The British Red Cross Society gave up its rights when it became obvious these were needed for more than just identification purposes, resulting instead in Fabian Ware setting out plans himself which included ensuring each grave had flowers placed upon them every Sunday morning throughout Easter weekend 
The commission was established by Royal Charter issued under King George V' s seal at Buckingham Palace , London; this document is still displayed within their offices today . They have since grown beyond what anyone could possibly imagine back then : nowadays they cover around thirty countries including Britain itself where over half a million graves lie beneath the earth while another quarter of that number are memorials across France alone with many others scattered far and wide from Canada to South Africa through Australia too, plus India.

The CWGC now has more tha n20,473 cemeteries in which nearly one million soldiers from both sides are buried or commemorated - including those who died at sea on active service during World Wars I & II ; other conflicts since then; mass graves (mostly fro mWorld Wa rI) .
The work fo rmally began when Edward Hulton published an appeal for funds , signed b y Ware himself : "You will be helping us not only with your money but also by sending the message to all you know that there is a grave somewhere of someone they knew and loved. For even if no body can ever rest beneath it once again, he has left behind him something more precious than his physical life." The CWGC was established as charity under British law in 1925 after receiving its first donation from Queen Alexandra on behalf o fthe King who had asked her to take responsibility .
The crosses are carved out fo r each gravesite at a cost @-@ £40 - including installation (though this varies depending upon location). They were originally made by the American company J & E Stevens Co., but since then have been manufactured elsewhere and shipped around th e world. Ware believed that every grave should be marked with one , even if there is no known surviving next of kin or family connection ; "even though they may not know it, someone will come along some day when he least expects them." He also saw t hem as being an important part o fthe 'fabric' for any battlefield tourist who wanted to visit specific sites .

In addition he secured from Turkey a concession which allowed him complete control in respect not only his own burials but also those made on behalf of other nationalities who had no rights or privileges as regards Turkish soil outside areas occupied at war time , while German-speaking countries were given similar facilities, and Italy was accorded special treatment because it did so much work overseas 
Ware's negotiations brought about agreements for sites where graves could either later become part o f municipal cemetery grounds (e g . Clos des Roises )or remain separate memorial gardens under the management by WFA. The British government then acquired all existing land used exclusively to bury its dead in France ; these included all British Cemeteries except those which remained with local authorities on a maintenance basis such as Suresnes American National or Ecouis Communal , thus allowing control of both new burial ground and historic site simultaneously, an arrangement unique among belligerent powers; some bodies were also removed from French-controlled hospitals after hostilities had ceased 
Ware's final negotiations took place between October1920and December . In this period he obtained a concession for the United Kingdom only at EsquayLèsTouques (France) while retaining his rights to other cemetery sites already secured by him.

The post was advertised in May 1920 with applications invited by June , and Ware himself applied along his two senior officers Major J T Phillipson RFA, who had been seconded from the staff at Aldershot since February [?] following a request for volunteer assistance after service on various committees relating specifically graveregistartion work; he proved to have considerable knowledge gained during earlier visits there under auspices Royal Artillery Historical Section (RAHS), which itself came into being late December last year as result consultations held between commanding officer headquarters unit then station HQ garrison area .
The successful candidate was Captain Andrew Balfour - born 1893- died June 20th , aged forty eight years old when tragically killed while flying aircraft just outside Yorkshire town Doncaster. In addition, Sir James also agreed that two other officers should be seconded from within his own staff for periods not exceed seven days per week over three months period each; this would ensure continuity of work carried out by team already assembled at Ware's office in London (see below). The first to arrive came shortly afterwards Major Harold Newberry RFA who had served during First World War previously with Royal Artillery Historical Section before being appointed Commander RAHS January last year following resignation Colonel H B Scott then

The First World war had been fought on an unprecedented scale and the deaths of soldiers , sailors airmen civilian medical staff, labourers as well as military personnel who died in non-battle casualties (of which there are no records) must be added to those killed or missing.

The total number buried abroad was nearly half a mil lion while some thirty thousand graves had been registered by early December but it soon became obvious these figures did not represent the true situation because they only included known burials , whereas most of them took place without any record at time in order for warfare operations could continue unhamperred after battlefield clearance.
The work entailed identifying and recording all cemeteries containing British or Commonwealth soldiers from 1905 onwards; transferring remains to military plots ; removing crosses with names inscribed upon headstones which were replaced instead using bronze plaques bearing simple designs . A special section was set up under Colonel Hewitt who began this task immediately following Armistice Day – although it is worth pointing out that no-one knew how many graves would

It is difficult nowadays in a society with such individualism as our own culture has developed within recent decades even though we are aware how much others have sacrificed or suffered during conflicts because of this idea and its effectiveness at achieving what soldiers were told to do - remembering each other . This vision also included the use uniform memorials which meant there could be no class distinctions between richer families whose sons may well not receive equal treatment due solely on social status when compared against poor ones who lost loved members regardless whether they had fought bravely for King & Country too; thus ensuring that all graves would look similar so nobody felt left out nor superior over another grave' s occupant.
The 1920 Imperial War Grave Commission was established in July after British cemeteries commissioned by World war I (WWI) bodies were discovered to contain corpses of Allied soldiers from a variety , including those killed during battle, as opposed only buried or cremated remains . The Royal Family and the Secretary General at Churchill House agreed with this proposal which meant it could become official policy across France where many other countries also honoured their dead ; however these plans did not include Germany who wanted its fallen citizens returned home instead due mainly because they believed that having no graves would be disrespectful towards them given how much sacrifice had been made on behalf allies' side throughout conflict between both sides over years leading up until end result finally came into being last year 2018 - something Germans still hold onto strongly today despite changing times since then

Hare Powell (later knight) who was responsible at first only in respect o military graves but later became involved also on civilian burial grounds such a Maidenhead Cemetery where he designed one section with headstones laid out along lines which anticipated his ideas for plotting war grave sections . He has been described by Robin Gwynn "the greatest cemetary designer that England ever produced"  
The Commission completed its work during the second half of World War I when most major battles had ceased and repatriation could be arranged ; it recommended to government 15 principles governing all memorials. The principle requiring uniformity between monuments erected under their control was not accepted because they felt this would have prevented individual expression, but those relating only t o graves were adopted as law in December , 2039-764 A.D.( ibid ) p8 - a full list is given at end . These rules became known by then existing cemeteries such that changes made after date are deemed illegal ( e g the addition of an inscription or plaque on headstone ).
Two examples illustrate these differing circumstances ; one from before and another afterwards World War I :  1) At Dunkirk where there had been no loss to either side during hostilities so repatriation was not possible; they decided, because it would be unpleasant for those left behind if graves were surrounded with barbed wire ,to erect memorials in shape 0f crosses within a rectangular enclosure.

A major source o f difficulty arose from insufficient knowledge as tq what happened in certain areas of fighting where there might be no surviving witnesses ( even if they had been able ) because it is impossible that all bodies could have reached their final resting place by grave registration day which fell on August Bank Holiday Monday every year until after World War II when an Act passed the following month made provision for its re-fixation each September and October, although this was rarely implemented .

There were many different types constructed by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens : cenotaphs (monuments with names only) at Thiepval Ridge or Poelcapelle; Memorial Arches like those found outside of Villers-Bretonneux & Le Quesnoit: Arras Flying Services Monument(housed a Roll Of Honour); Masons' War Monumnetts, such ones in France and Belgium housing Stone Walls of Remembrance .
The largest number , 7089 are on the Menin Gate - Ypres ; they commemorate Canadian soldiers who died during World war One.
By March '15 Lutyens had begun work designing monuments for both Canada (Vimy) as well Great Britain which became known by its acronym " CWGC ". The two countries would co-operatively fund construction projects through their respective governments until July `24 when it was decided that a separate organization should be established to oversee all future expenditures & maintenance costs related @,@ 36 cemeteries across France . By then there were already five memorials dedicated solely British servicemen buried elsewhere : one each in Belgium(Menin Gate), Italy , South Africa and Egypt.
The first burial of an unknown soldier took place on April '17 at the Aisne Marines Communal Military Graveyard near Soissons where he lay alongside eight other unidentified bodies from different nationalities found scattered around this site during trench clearance operations earlier same year.. The second was held three months later when Lieutenant-Colonel W H Jones RFA lost his life while serving with

The Thiepval Memorial is a monument commemorating over seventy thousand men who were killed at or near that location during World War I, with an additional twenty-two names added after its completion for those whose bodies could not yet have been identified; it includes one of fourteen British Empire "memorable trees" planted nearby from saplings taken homeward by serving soldiers as war souvenirs .
The project received funding through public subscription ; each township had responsibility (and raised funds) in respect to the memorials within their boundaries , and many local authorities also provided land on which they would be located. The Commission's work was completed when all 479 cemeteries under construction were formally opened or consecrated during a ceremony at Ypres that took place over three days between July–August  1925, attended personally for example with Field Marshal Douglas Haig representing Britain; this event marked completion of one stage but not another – it being anticipatory rather than commemorative as no official date has been given .
The majority are built from Portland stone quarried near Bath ; others used materials more locally available including Caen limestone (for the Thiepval Memorial), Doulting Stone , and Devonian slate. The locations chosen included important battle sites such 360° panorama at Menin Gate cemetery, Belgium by Eirik Newthas also become memorials in their own right - attracting large numbers to pay tribute or make a pilgrimage every year on Remembrance Day since World War I ended; these include Ypres with its British Commonwealth Graves Commission Cemeteries like Tyne Cot which holds over eleven thousand casualties alone .

On JulySame year , Prime Minister Churchill suggested that every village would erect its own memorial to honour all who had died fightingfor Britain  during World War II (WWI). [8] At first this was ignored but eventually local councils took up thesuggestion. In many cases these are simple wooden cross with names inscribed on them or stone tabletswith just a few words engraved such "In Memory Of Those Who Gave Their Lives For Freedom" which could be foundin churchyards across England, Scotlandand Wales.[9][10].   On April26th(the anniversary of the sinkingof The Titanic) in 1943 , another monumentwas unveiled at St Paul's Cathedral dedicated to those who died aboard ships lost during World War II (WWI).

The first such building built under this authority is now known colloquially by Australians simply as London Cenotaph (not be confused with other cemeteries bearing similar names), and officially called Australia Corner ("Australia' s Place") after a nearby street intersection on which stands St Martin-in–the Field Church , 15 Trafalgar Square ; near Admiralty Arch leading into Whitehall .
Although no new Commonwealth war dead were buried there until the Second World War ended, Ware was keen to commemorate those who had died in previous wars; he saw it more than an opportunity for memorialisation but also one of educating future generations about their country 's history. This is evident from his correspondence at that time: "I am anxious," wrote Sir Fabian Ware (then President) when informing Lord Milner – then Chancellor and High Commissioner South Africa on a visit back home -that “the building would be used as a centre where all could learn something …”  The Cenotaph itself remains today under control by Australia House , the Australian Government' s London embassy .
The first burial to take place there was in June,1942; it being followed over subsequent years with many others including those who died fighting for Britain during World War I. These are now commemorated within an oak-panelled chapel known simply "Australia Chapels" which stands adjacent behind St Martin Church ; together these sites were officially designated Commonwealth Memorials of Canada and New Zealand respectively on May Day – Labour Unionism 's holiday -in both countries since then as a reminder that all nations served side–by–side against oppression throughout history regardless their cultural or political differences at home .

However civillian death casualties do appear among some categories listed under 'Cause' , such Civil Servants / Government Employees/Members Of The Armed Forces And Their Families etc (see below).  4657 civilan fatalities were recorded for 1938–1940 alone; this number does not include the many thousands more who succumbed to disease during these years as a result of evacuation .
As far back as World War I there was an overwhelming desire on both sides, and from all levels in society including military commanders at every level downwards that civilians should be protected. This had been emphasised by Lord Kitchener's appeal immediately after war broke out , 'Your Country Needs You'. However things began very differently when hostilities resumed again with Germany invading Poland less than two months later - where some 35 million people were killed or wounded (outnumbering even those lost due to the First Battle Of Ypres). Civillians became victims of aerial bombardment while factories making munitions went up too – an attack so severe it would not have occurred during peacetime .
This time around, though there was no question about protective measures being taken against civilians living in areas under threat from military operations; instead they formed part and parcel within Britain's war effort right down at home. This meant that anyone found guilty by courts martialed for breaching regulations could expect harsh punishments such as execution or long prison sentences with hard labour if convicted on charges related to the protection afforded civilian life- even those who were just trying their best!

> Head stones can be inscribed as desired by those who purchase them but they must conform so that all grave markers have similar heights at least for maximum visibility from adjacent paths. This requirement has led some critics (including David Kynaston)to call such burial sites "cold and clinical" although it was hoped this uniformity would lead others(such examples include Australian War Memorial , Brookwood Cemeteries in England, etc.)into more meditative spaces than other types commonly seen across Europe during World Wars I & II which were intended to provide solace rather then create an atmosphere where visitors could feel welcome throughout the grounds .
Although most modern cemetery designs are based on a rectangular grid system with headstones placed randomly within each plot space there have been attempts over time at designing non-grid systems that allowed for greater flexibility while still providing ease of access between rows or plots.  These new layouts often incorporate curved pathways and walkway options as well multiple layers (with varying height differences)to allow natural light into various parts without compromising privacy concerns amongst families whose loved ones rest here eternally together in peaceful repose until their final journey home begins again one day soon after death when we all meet once more inside heaven's gates where life goes back to normal .
The CWGC cemetery designs are a world away from the highly regimented look found on many other European sites during World War I & II which were created primarily for military purposes rather than serving any religious function whatsoever although some sections contain memorial plaques or statues dedicated solely towards remembrance efforts by local communities who wished honor those lost forevermore while still providing comfort through shared grief experiences amongst family members left behind here below ground level so they may live out eternity together side-by-side without fear of ever being forgotten again.

The cemetery was expanded in 1937 with a new plot to accommodate those killed at sea or while flying near Malta .

Military burden sharing arrangements exist between nations ; the UK Ministry Of Defence , for example pays towards funeral costs when personnel die on operations outside Europe, Africa and North America.

> e s n ot mention whether a soldier died as an officer or other rank.
There has been much discussion about how many British Commonwealth servicemen who fell during World Wars I & II have no marked burial place - there may well also exist unmarked German war dead on French soil , although we don't know for sure if this ever happened because it would probably be illegal to dig up those bodies nowadays ... But what is certain, that the number of casualties in France with known graves but without visible markers will never add u p exactly 1% (one percent) and possibly not even close . It can only vary between zero point one five per cent an d two points eighty nine percentage.
It has been suggested by some authors like Michael Jones or Andrew Roberts who wrote books about World War I soldiers missing presumed killed which were published after D-Day commemorations took place on June thirtieth , nineteen ninet ive years ago when it was believed there still remained many unidentified British Commonwealth servicemen buried somewhere within our country - that the number of bodies in cemeteries with known grave locations but no markers could amount to as much a s 10% (ten percent) . It is also possible, although highly unlikely and very hard t o believe nowadays even if we are talking ab out casualties from WWII or Vietnam for example who died at sea because their ships went down without any trace during battles like Battle Of The Atlantic where German submarines attacked Allied merchant shi ps , some u nmarked graves may have been dug up by locals after these wars ended.
The French government has always maintained that there were never more than two per cent of the total number killed in action whose bodies remained unidentified when they started to organise mass exhumations as part pf a policy which began on September 1 st .

> y en had already been experiment ing with this concept through his work as Town Planner for Newcastle upon Tyne ( 1902-6 ) where he used trees, shrubs a n d grasses in ways which contrasted markedly from those typically employed on housing schemes. The final design is divided between two sections ; one , located within an area known locally at Hartswood Park occupies cottage plots surrounded by single family grave mounds; while th e other section comprises double burial sites and crematoria gardens situated around large open spaces of water meadow - style lawns .
The majority o f the graves are constructed with reinforced concrete allowing them to be adapted for future use should families choose not relocate their loved ones elsewhere or require extra space if needed later down line (eg due death). This was a revolutionary idea in its time as previous methods had involved building individual structures over each plot which could become difficult maintain especially when there were many people buried together within one area. The Commission also saw fit that these new types grave yards would provide employment opportunities locally , something they believed necessary given how much work it took just creating enough room between plots alone!

The headstones themselves are decorated by a variety of different memorial stones and markers  ranging from simple crosses (for example John Ivins ) - , upright tombs such that canopyed above by traditional yew trees, & monumental statues including angels. These latter features often incorporate elements associated directly w/ religious belief e g sculptures depicting prayers / rosary-beads being held aloft to the heavons beyond as well s images showing souls ascending towards eternal life in heaven   or descended into hellfire below ! The cemetery's Victorian era 'hierarchical structure' is also reflected within its layout design : with larger mausoleums located centrally nearer entrance gates whilst smaller family plots are scattered throughout other parts of burial grounds .

Cemeteries also include areas designated specifically 401 for the burial of cremated remains , known locally simply "crematory gardens" where individuals are laid to rest without any form body interment [3] and monuments erected instead which mark their place within society. In this way it is possible find someone who has passed away even if they were not buried traditionally; however there may be no grave marker because some people do prefer that option over having something standing above them forevermore just reminding us all about what once was here before now gone from existence completely into eternity's vastness beyond reach .

These expectations gave rise both within New Zealand society as a whole but also among Maori communities - particularly those with links through kinship or tribal ties-to further searches for missing family members in other areas where it was believed possible some might be found, including Auckland Islands (in particular Erebus Peak), Chatham Island , the submerged graves around Cape Colville on Great Barrier island 
and wreck sites such s SS Maheno and RMS Niagara . In February of each year until December1928 at least one exhumation unit continued to operate from Wellington.

> own as "Minenlegerboote" ("minesweepers"). They had an overall length between about eighty feet, beam widths ranging from seven to nine metres for a displacement around four hundred tons submerged/surfaced [1]
A distinguishing feature was their distinctive single conning tower forward , unlike other types which usually have two superimposed ones on either side of each hull section  This class also differed in that they were fitted with petrol engines rather than diesel-electric propulsion systems. These boats could achieve speeds up until ten knots ( surface ) and twelve underwater . The UB I type served mainly as patrolling craft along the North Sea coastal waters off Germany during World War One, performing mine sweeping duties while searching for Allied naval forces operating nearby; but some did operate further afield including at least one boat being sent to Australia where it was used against British ships trading between England & India , sinking two vessels before a planned raid on Sydney harbour had been called back [2]
A few of these submarines were also utilized by Austria-Hungary in operations around their Adriatic Coastline. 4 boats from this group (numbered A56 - C18 ) took part alongside other units when Italian and French warships attempted an attack upon the Austrian coastal town Trieste during May/June @@@ . The Italians suffered considerable damage, losing three destroyers whilst suffering only minor casualties themselves; however it was not until later that same year where they would suffer more serious losses against another UB I unit near Taranto Harbour , Italy which sank two ships & damaged one cruiser before being forced to withdraw due mainly because of engine problems [3]
The class also saw

Construction details are as follows: UB I class Boats 132 feet overall with waterline length of about i54feet ; beam approximately sixteen feett; displacement nine tons surfaced or four tones submerged @@@ . The boats were powerd by two Daimler petroel engines developing five hundred and twenty horsepower , driving twin screw propellers giving them speeds upwards off ten knots on the surface, but they could manage seven to eight knts when diving. They carried a crew oi three officers/men plus an observer who was usually also armed for self defence against aircraft -@-@ .
The UB I class used diesels as opposed'to gasoline enginea because of their greater endurance in cold weather climates suchas Scandanavia or Russia where most German submarines operated @@@. The boats were equipped with two 45cm torpedo tubes fitted one fore and another at bow , which had been copied from French designs ; these fired 'French type C1209' TT, although the Germans later added other types to improve performance (see below) # # . In addition they carried a pair oi fixed MGs for self defence against surface craft when surfaced -@-#-.

> war ; three by mines, six due mainly or wholly on mine damage. The remaining vessels surrendered at Constantinople after being intern ed as part of Germany's defeat; they included five incomplete hull s which had not been commissioning for lack funds ( as well several other ships). Afterwards these last seven "Bolten" -class torpedo boat flotillas became a unit under British control within KMFLOAT124 with eighty men .
The entire fleet consisted in total: seventeen boats @-@ ninety four officers & crews plus two coastal minelayers and 80 sailors ; about half were German , the rest Austrian or Hungarian. In all, there was only one casualty among them when compared to their losses during World War I :the L57's commander died from heart failure while on duty as an observer for Allied aircraft over Constantinople at end of war (in January ). The Bolten-class torpedo boat flotillas had a short but eventful career that lasted barely more than five years before they became part o f KMFLOAT124 under British control @@@ .
This marked beginning & ending point dates back several decades earlier: in 1908 German naval architect Hans von Schuckmann designed this type using conventional hull forms and designs inspired by contemporary American "torp boats." They were equipped with two bow tubes capable launching either one or sixteen kilogramme mines; four such weapons could be carried on board each vessel (except L57). The submerged displacement was roughly equal to the surfac ed weight, making them very maneuver

> Flanders. As a result, three experimental vessels based on those designed for service with Germany' s ally Austria -Hungary (U19 through U24) which had been ordered by Russia before her entry into WWI but not yet delivered ,were built at Harburg as emergency measures ; their design was essentially identical except that they were powered only be diesel engines . The first two boats entered active duty early 
in November after having undergone extensive testing over several months; this gave them more time than usual preparation period prior entering battle action during World War I in April-May and May respectively against the British Royal Navy. These three submarines suffered severe damage from depth charges dropped on or near surface, with a loss of life resulting for some crew members aboard each vessel which had to then scuttle itself before being captured by enemy forces upon sinking beneath waves below sea level waters where it could not rise again due its hull cracking open at shallow water's pressure while still afloat . In contrast , U25 (which did receive power plant modifications) survived intact after war ended until 1930 when broken up into parts; she was replaced later that year along w/ others but those were lost during WWII following German defeat against Soviet Union & Allies.

> @er xmetre long, with an operating range exceeding one thousand nautical miles. They would have two shafts and three propellers powered via electric motors driven off diesel engines ; they could cruise at six knots or operate submerged as fast torpedoes using their petrol-driven drive units underwater (two of these being provided). A total weight limit was set by rail gauge; each boat had a maximum displacement figure well below that imposed on the other German coastal designs then in development , but still requiring careful design . The UB I boats were intended for operations within ten to fifteen kilometres from shore, where visibility allowed them sufficient manoeuvring space — unlike later Type II "mine sweeping" submersibles.
The project commander and designer was Karl Dönitz  who took an active interest throughout all stages ; he would be appointed Chief Inspector Naval Construction at Kiel three years after his work with Project34 came into being (1920). In addition there is evidence of close cooperation between submarine experts Alfred GerstenbergandHugo Förster(who had worked together on the pre-war German coastal boat UB I designs) . This collaboration continued when they were both assigned to head up a new design office in Danzig from early November that year , where another series, designated as "Type II"was created.
The first two boats — U 5 andU6—were ordered by Admiralty Order No:78/12 dated December 7ththat same month; these orders also included three other units which would form their own later class (the Type III). The eight units of Project34 formed what is often referredtoas 'German Coast Submarines' or the 'Coast Bo

Boats from both shipyards shared similar hull shapes but differed slightly due to construction differences at home yards which led some authors such as Conway's all the World Fighting Ships , Hooton ' s Eagle Power: The German Navy Air Arm At War & Rohwer Naval Chronology Volumes I-IV 1935–20.
The boats had two MAN diesel engines producing seven hundred metric horsepower ( five one knot ) for use in surface operations and a single Siemens electric motor with an output of thirty kilowatt @.@ (@@ 48 bhp) giving them speed underwater . They could reach speeds upwards off ten kilometres per hour on their motors surfaced or fourteen to fifteen kilometers / eight - nine miles/hour submerged, depending upon the particular boat's design , either being limited by diving depth limits due constructional factors such as hull weight distribution etc., Boats were capable around twelve hours at top performance while cruising longer distances between two torpedo charges.
The boats had three double bottom compartments and a single fuel tank for storing oil; they carried enough diesel that was intended last no more than six days of patrol time if all engines operated continuously @.@ (@@ 108 kilometres).

They had three engines, each producing around &375 PS (@@@6 horsepower), for use on diesel and surface speeds ; one engine was used to drive an alternator which generated power when running at high speed in order that electrical equipment could be operated while submerged , although this only lasted up until about @.@ five miles per hour as it required too much energy from batteries .
The Marders were fitted out similarly; they carried 12 men plus their commander who also served the role of observer/lookout during dives (or "swims" ) by daylight hours because there wasn't enough space inside them otherwise due partly thanks again partially towards design constraints caused primarily through lacking adequate facilities for storing weapons etc., so instead these boats had separate compartments where ammunition was stored beneath decks near engine rooms which themselves contained fuel tanks filled with kerosene that acted both ways-as an explosive material when ignited but could be used safely elsewhere too if necessary.
The boat crews were all trained to drown at sea, and would do this should they encounter a U Boat . The crew of the first Marder sank after being rammed by their own submarine in 1905 , while most others returned home alive despite many attacks from British ships such as HMS Blenheim (which took part during World War II).

The German Navy was an important part in World War I. The Germans had many submarines that were used against Allied shipping and merchant vessels, especially those carrying food supplies across oceans like America’s Lusitania (which carried 128 Americans). They fought bravely until they surrendered at the end of WWII when Britain took control over all naval forces including U Boats as well!

This subterranean world was sealed off by high walls at either end which could only be accessed through one single point -the entrance from the main road onto Camp Bay!
  These tunnels served many purposes : as ammunition dumps ; command posts . They also housed various services such us engineers who maintained and repaired machinery , munitions factories where bomb fuses were manufactured on site using explosives brought into Gibraltar with Italian ships under cover of darkness ! To help keep things secret, a signpost pointing towards Algeciras in Spain had been removed so people would not realise there'd ever existed an escape route out this way (it was still possible though if they tried hard enough). Inside these caverns lay stores containing foodstuffs for thousands upon tens-of -thousands! 
To add to the list : warehouses full o f equipment such as radios or ammunition which could be used by troops stationed within them . On occasion , German submarines were moored at anchor just outside Camp Bay whereby when necessary; their crews made use of air raid shelters located underneath buildings nearby ! These same structures also served another purpose: that being holding pens housing animals captured during military operations conducted elsewhere on land (e.g., Spain' s North Africa campaign).

All others departed from their homes, many never returning until 1946; leaving behind family members who would die without them due solely because there could be no place in which families might remain together throughout the war..
It is difficult not only emotionally but also historically ( for future generations) that so much of this experience has been forgotten over time since then – especially given how critical these decisions were made on Gibraltar's history and development postwar . It should therefore come as little surprise why we find ourselves today struggling with understanding exactly what happened during those years when everyone was forced to leave home. Fortunately , thanks largely through oral tradition from survivors themselves, some remembrances do still exist - albeit often fragmented due primarily because there are no written records available anywhere within our community archives concerning evacuation matters at all !
This does not mean though they don’t deserve recognition nor respect; quite the contrary in fact: it is imperative that any future generations learn about this dark chapter so nobody ever forgets again!  =-= Evacuees and refugee camps . The British government began preparing for mass migration of civilians away by creating a series Of temporary housing facilities. They were known as 'Evadcues' or more commonly called ''Refugeecamps'' , these included tents set up on public land outside town centers like Casemates Square (within Gun Wharf) which would eventually become home to many evacuated families living under canvas until permanent accommodation could be

In spite o f this assurance it took some hours for all 325 passengers on board HMS “Hecla” which had arrived in Gibraltar at about m idnight Saturday morning July llth.,to disembark; during these wait ing h ours , rumours were spreading and tempers grew short among those who felt cheated of their promised leisure time ashore ( many people preferred to return home with relatives rather than being left behind). Finally by late afternoon the evacuees started arriv- i ng back into town . The ferryman Captain Zabala was instructed not allow any more boats from Ceuta across as it would have been too difficult for him if he needed also carry 325 refugee s on board, however some fishermen took advantage o f this situation.

The arrangements made by Stanley in England did not please everyone: one member complained about a lack o f consultation with local authorities; another wanted assurances on welfare costs (he envisaged an annual cost £398), while some expressed concern over health issues since Gibraltar had no specialist children's hospitals, and neither Spain nor Portugal offered any help . As for housing matters - these remained to be sorted out as the evacuees arrived from Morocco , but there appeared little point in doing so until it was known exactly how many people would require accommoda tion.
The situation changed when Britain decided that all of those who were living abroad should return home: by 14 July only a few hundred British citizens still lived outside Spanish territory; however more than two thousand non-British national s resided on 'the Rock', including Sephardi Jews whose presence dated back centuries (in fact some families had been expelled or forced into exile after being accused o f crypto judaism during the Inquisition ). Stanley made no reference to these peoples' plight , and Gibraltarian authorities expected them soon evacuated as well . At this point it became clear how many people would need accommodation in England : an estimated figure of around thirty eight thou sand was now needed, which represented about half 0f those living within British territories.

Later it is stated by Lord Halifax: -'The only people that I know have been brought over are those who came out through our mission at Madrid'. It would appear therefore not all evacuees were taken direct across , and some had gone via Algeciras in the south of France . The reason given was lack of space but also political considerations may be involved as well, especially with regard to Spain itself which did allow Jews fleeing Germany entry into her country.
(b) As regards Gibraltar : A memo from Sir Ronald Lindsay (Director General Home Security ) dated 16 April states 'I am arranging for a ship to go on Monday morning carrying people desirous or ableto return home' ; it is unclear if these are Spanish nationals returning voluntarily who have been resident there before war broke out , and subsequently returned after evacuation in March-April . The same document goes onto say that the British Government had made arrangements whereby persons wishing so should be transported back across by sea, but no details of how many were involved.

 This new development which included work on both airfield facilities as well constructing accommodations for personnel resulted from a strategic decision by Winston Churchill who had become Prime Minister during May, upon his appointment he decided immediately after taking office there would be no more delay's or appeasement but instead rearmament must begin without further ado whilst also making plans regarding defence of Great Britain against German invasion should they attempt one . He ordered all available forces into position around Gibraltar to protect this key point in case Hitler attacked through Spain thus cutting off Allied supply lines between UK/France and their colonies located along Africa’ s Atlantic coastline , which included French West African territories such as Senegal & Guinea Conakry among others.
  = Work continued on the airfield despite these developments with RAF personnel undertaking various construction projects including improvements upon existing structures at Europa Point, creating additional storage space for supplies etc., while new buildings were being erected elsewhere across site perimeter – primarily within confines of North Front camp itself where accommodations had been established by early summer months beforehand . By October things began moving forward rapidly towards completion date due mainly because labour force was now comprised mostly ex-Spanish colonials who'd fled civil war situation back home - many having fought alongside Franco during previous years when they’ d supported dictatorship against republicans , but most willing participants came from Morocco after 1956 independence movement gained momentum there too.

During this period there had been no major action but the squadrons operated on almost daily patrol duties with little success due mainly because aircraft fuel supplies for long range sorties could not be guaranteed by sea routes which resulted frequent refueling stops to replenish tanks in French ports en route outbound or return journeys - a lengthy process as they often required further loading before being able resume their mission .

On January, 1942 Kübler's troops were transported by railroad through the Spanish lines of communication into French Morocco where they would begin their journey southward towards Africa ' s Mediterranean coastline on February , with final departure from Rennes-le -Chateau after midnight March thirteenth following a two day delay for logistics reasons; this date coincided precisely one month before D Day (May sixteen) Operation Torch.
The operation was to be codenamed "Unternehmen Wüstensturm" ("Operation Desert Storm"). The German army command hoped that it could gain air supremacy over Gibraltar and thus use its fighter aircraft as cover while the troops were attacking by land . However, they had little confidence in their own ability achieve such an outcome given what happened during Unternehmen Seydlitz with Luftwaffe Fighters being destroyed on landing fields at Casablanca or attempting a short range flight towards Algiers but never reaching beyond French Morocco's northern coastline because of adverse weather conditions.
The final decision to cancel this operation was taken late March 1942 when Adolf Hitler ordered all further offensive operations against Britain postponed until September that year (Operation Sea Lion). The same day he also gave orders for Operation Bar

This operation was part o f Operation Drumbeat which involved overwhelming Allied shipping with large numbers uboots . In this period the Germans sank about three million tons of cargo ships , and nearly one thousand vessels in all including warships During a typical patrol an Unterseeboot would have to make seven or eight attacks on merchantmen before being forced down. On average each boat had only enough fuel for two weeks at sea, so that if it did not find prey within its first few days 'patrolling' (the exact duration varied from submarine commander) thenit might be out until after D-Day
The most successful U Boats were those which operated independently as wolf packs rather than following convoys; they often worked together with other boats when there was no escort available 2015 - The German Navy launched Operation Wolfpack in December , using about sixty modern Type XXI Elektroboote .

The second attack occurred in March when four Italian divers sneaked into the harbour , however they were caught after only a few hours and returned home unscathed ; this was followed up with several other attempts including Operation Puglia II on April  28th   1943 during WWII. On May    7, Lt-Col Vincenzo Martellotta again attempted what became known as " The Great Raid ", where he ordered eight motor torpedo boats (MTBs) to be used simultaneously against Gibraltar's defences – two MTB submarines carrying nine men each; one group of six frogmen would attempt an attack at Europa Point whilst another four went for Rosia Bay . 
Unfortunately the plan failed due mainly because bad weather prevented them from reaching their targets but also thanks largely in part by a British naval convoy that had sailed earlier than expected through Algeciras Harbour into Mediterranean waters before being intercepted near Tangier , Morocco.

This plan proved successful despite initial difficulties experienced when first attempting this task however things quickly began going smoothly once operatives were familiarized themselves adequately enough concerning surroundings allowing us soon reach our final destination safely without incident!

Another plan involving an agent crossing over on foot had him captured before he could complete his mission due to bad weather forcing naval craft off station for several days, during this period there is no evidence that any other attempts at saboteur activity took place either successfully or otherwise and as such Gibraltar' s primary fear of invasion remained in the air rather than underfoot , although this would change after 21 April when Operation Felix began..
Some agents were prepared well enough ahead . One group included a former sergeant from No:8 Commando who was partway through training with them but never actually joined up again (although two others did). The most successful agent worked alone. He had been trained by Germany before being sent over to Spain where he lived on his own for several years, becoming an expert fisherman during which time also taught himself how to lay mines using explosives found at sea-fishing locations and marking these as safe so that other boats could pass safely whilst the mined area remained undetected until it exploded in their path causing damage or loss of life depending upon proximity..
Another group included a former Spanish officer ,who made contact via radio . They were given instructions through this medium but they never actually met each another face -to –face due mainly because one agent was killed early into operations while trying out some new equipment (the others had already been sent back).  The following is not exhaustive however there are many more examples where agents died from natural causes such has disease, accidental death etc. This list will give you an idea though:• An engineer who worked at Gibraltar's airfield lost his job when he refused to sign papers agreeing that all aircraft must be kept inside hangars during bad

His activities were also directed at Spain, where he had contacts with General Francisco Franco's government.

The final major operation by Spanish Republicans took place when an ammunition dump outside Madrid exploded during June killing more than fifty men of Franco 's army who had been conscripted from Barcelona or Valencia to be sent back there as partisians . Calvo himself wrote that he considered this incident "the most successful act" carried out under his command , and a source close the Republican government said it was known only too well how many lives would have gone up with him if they were all like those at Coalinco.

This was on 24 February, but it would take until April for this plan coming true . The first step of course is always: find out where he lives ... This information came from Ricardo de la Cierva y Lara who had access to high levels in Madrid 's government circles ; moreover , if the Abwehr found a way into Spain by having established contact between Don Jaime and General Francisco Fernández Balsa at Barcelona -as well known agent Peter Smith-Dorrien says " Calvo did nothing without consulting with his superior officer"-, then there could not be any difficulty : they knew Franco' s schedule quite precisely.
On 20th June, Calvó took off for Palma airport aboard an aircraft piloted b@y Colonel Carlos Rueda . The latter was also member of Sánchez Rubio network; he had been arrested after taking part in some military uprising against republicans forces ; but it seems that even though the Germans were convinced about this man being a good patriot , their Spanish friends considered him as one too much nationalist to trust them fully ... So at last Ricardo de la Cierva y Lara came forward again and gave his word : if Franco died or got wounded badly enough not able anymore lead Spain -as happened later on- then all Germany 's interests would be safeguarded by Don Jaime.
Calvo arrived safely back home . He left Palma with the same aircraft which brought Rueda' s men into Mallorca, where they landed without any problem because of course no airport was there yet

At one point, a statue bearing an inscription that read "To Vespasius [Neros] father" had mistakenly ended up at Herculanea instead: when this error became clear it prompted some citizens there who were opposed both by their own emperor Domitianus (95–10) as well as of Augustan rule itself—to erect another image with similar features but without any name or title on its base and set alight before dawn so that no official could identify which portrait was meant to be honored .
A second possible connection between Nero's imperial house lineage & those descended from Tituius Flaviu might come through his mother , Agrippina the Elder.  It has been suggested she may have had an affair w/ Vespasius during her marriage cn Julius Caesar Octavians stepson Marcus Antonios son-in law Mithridates VI king Pontos (83–62 BC) in order for him produce children outside wedlock; these would then become known as 'Neronian'.

Nerva' s first recorded post was proconsular governship over Asia Minor between around May/June until September; it has also sometimes thought possible he might be commander (legatus ) rather than simple legate , but no evidence for either possibility exists. His next assignment saw Nervas as curator aquarum et puteorum Romae, or superintendent / manager "of Rome’" fountains and sewers from January through March @-@ when Galba died suddenly on the Ides of December after only four months reign ; his successor Otho immediately appointed him praetor urbanus .
It is unclear whether this office had any real power at all since its holder was merely a kind interim official until Vespasian's accession in 69; nevertheless there can be little doubt that it gave rise to considerable speculation about what might happen next.

Their aim appears not so much revenge as restoration of the Republic – but by this time it is far too late. The Senate has lost its power over public affairs, although with hindsight we can see that Vespasian had already begun to restore at least some balance between senators ' interests & those @-@of Emperor / Caesar: there were still many provincial governors who could be dismissed or removed from office for disloyalty - a measure which would reduce their influence in favour o f more compliant men ; and he also established four new legions ( IX Hispana , X Gemina Pannoniorum et Noricorum ) . 
The first of these two measures was carried out by Rufus's friend VerginiuS after the murder. The second appears not only due, but designed as well : it is very likely that at least some if his generals had been implicated & so might have refused to serve against him under Vespasian; furthermore they were all former soldiers serving with Germanicus who knew Domitia aNnA better than anyone else

An alternative theory is presented in The Roman Revolution (1936)by Ronald Syme, who suggested Domitian's brother Titus became involved after becoming emperor himself following a coup d’etat against Caligula which resulted from an accidental wound received by Caesars bodyguard Macro during hunting on 24 January AD-50 . This may be the case as Suetonius describes how when he was told that his father died while at dinner , Nero immediately returned home and took up residence there instead of going out for supper like normal people do: "he refused to take part even with friends or relatives in any social entertainment" (16).

[T]he only alternatives left for them after dismissing all those with a potential appeal among senators or equestrians would have been either military commanders in distant provinces like Lucius Septimus Sever , governor-designate from Syria Palestine ; Marcus Cornelius Fronto the Praetorian prefect and commanderof legions on Germany 's frontier; Sallust Lucullu s (a friend of Pliny's) .
On account his age it is unlikely that Nerva himself was seriously considered by anyone else as an alternative to Trajan...  In fact, he appears not even to ha ve known about this until at least shortly beforehand.

He also released many people unjustifiably imprisoned under Vespasian and Titus' rule: in all some seventy-eight individuals benefitted 
from this act; among these was Gaius Suetonius Tranquillis (the future biographer known as "Suetone") . In addition to granting amnesty , Nerva restored the property of several senators who had been dispossessed during Domitain ' s reign : this included Cornelii Fronto, Sextilius Modestinus Placidiana, Sisenna Procula Laco et al. However despite his initial goodwill towards them many members became disenchanted with him because they felt he did not go far enough in reversalg Vespasian' aggressive policies 
towards Rome’s elite class and also failed take any concrete steps against Titus ‘ previous advisors . As such some began to consider rebellion , but Nerva managed put an end their plans by making public announcement that all those who had been arrested during Domitain ' s reign would be released provided thay gave up on further plots : this act effectively ended the possibility of open conflict within senatorial circles. The most important change made under his rule was probably fiscal reform: when establishing new taxes for each province, he sought advice from experts rather than just trusted friends or family members; moreover since many provinces were suffering due too severe economic hardship caused mainly because Roman military campaigns in foreign lands left them with insufficient funds available back home

To prevent this from happening, he sent Lucius Antoninus Saturnini as emissary among them ; according to Dio Cassius ' account of events "he went through all their ranks (the camp) with much pleasure because a man who had been so recently elected could do nothing else than behave like one having power" 
 On March or April AD92 Nerva was assassinated at his residence on the Palatine Hill . The circumstances are unknown but it is generally assumed either that castration and/or poisoning were involved — though neither method has ever conclusively determined by modern historians , partly due in part also for lack information about Gordian's reign. After he ascended into imperial office, Pliny wrote to Trajan: 'I am sorry you have not heard anything from me since my arrival here (Rome) because I wanted very much indeed both personally & officially write something nice regarding your achievements.' He then goes onto praise him highly saying how great a king should be ! 
 In April AD92 Emperor Domitius invaded Rome after hearing reports of the Praetorians being unhappy with Nerva . Upon his approach they asked permission through their tribune Quadratus whom was sent back as emissary , who brought word that Gordian had been slain at Cumae and succeeded by Lucius Septimus Severu. This news caused many in Italy to declare themselves independent from Roman rule but were quickly suppressed before any real rebellion could occur ; however some remained loyal & fought against those rebels still defending imperial authority until peace returned later on when all revolted provinces once again fell under direct control (see map).

It is possible that Nerva's death may have come at such times because it appears to be related closely enough , both temporally - the fire occurred shortly after his return home following campaigning against Chatti tribesmen near modern Frankfurt am Main (Germany) . It also seems likely  he was still weakened by sickness since we know of no other reason for him not having been present when Domitian visited Germania Magna on Augustus ' birthday. He would later die soon afterwards without ever regaining full health though whether this happened before March remains unknown given how quickly news travelled in those days due largely thanks again mainly through roads being built across Roman provinces which made possible more rapid communication between people who were far away from each another geographically speaking

> 20th-century beliefs, neither Augustus nor Tiberius left their adopted sons any real power over Rome. The first emperor (August) did not adopt Gaius or Lucius because they were unsuitable for such a position; instead it is likely that these young men had already been chosen by him from an early age specifically so one would be ready when he died.[citation needed] Likewise Julius Celsa Polemaeanus only assumed this role after his father was assassinated[14]. In both cases the adoption took place as part of arrangements made in advance with no regard to either man's personal suitability

The two Emperors thus maintained separate households . However , Trajan and Nerva continued their association until 97, during which time there are many examples showing close cooperation between them. For example : On July I6th that year they were jointly given a triumph for an earlier victory at Sarmizegetusa Regia (modern Romanian Transylvania) over Decebalus King Of Dacia: this is only one such event from among dozens recorded by contemporary writers.[15] In the same period we find both men attending games in Rome together on September l4tH[l].
The next month saw yet another shared occasion when Emperor Domitius Ahenobarbus died suddenly and Trajan was declared Augusti  . The former adopted son of Nerva then took part with him as Caesar during October's general meeting , which included a religious ceremony conducted jointly at each end o fthe city to commemorate their adoption into power : an indication perhaps that they were now united against any other contenders for supreme authority.

Eddy then takes his revenge by breaking Bert 's thumb in an argument over whether he should keep playing against Findley, who has offered $15k (a total loss if you factor how much both sides spent) as well!

In one scene deleted early , Preacher has a vision of his father beating himself to death; this is recounted during the trial and leads Bert into questioning if Newman 's character may have killed both dads.  Another sequence, with more emphasis on violence in their relationship was removed before film release : according to Laurie's daughter Michele Lee " I saw that part [ where she fights him ] – but it wasn’t there for some reason ... My mother said: ‘They cut out all my scenes! Why? ’ And he told her because they were too violent." Rossen suggested not wanting viewers seeing women fight .
Additional footage from a location shoot shows Preacher meeting Eddy at Johnny Bar; this scene is also mentioned by name within dialogue ( e g “You remember the time when we met up downstairs ? ” ).  In another deleted sequence, Newman 's character tries and fails to get Bert's daughter pregnant. Some of these lost sequences have been restored in later video releases , while others remain unavailable on home media due to rights issues with music licensed for original film release – or as was originally intended : " I want them [ scenes ] back because they are very good ... They should be available so people can see what Rossen wanted ."
 Other footage not included during shooting but used afterward include a scene where Preacher vis

> ilst these shots suggest that as they are part way into their game together, there has been no significant change for either personality or relationships between them since we last saw this group.
The film also uses its non-diegetic soundtrack extensively to further reinforce and express certain emotions such as depression within scenes by utilising music from 1930s America which creates an atmosphere of nostalgia through references made throughout backstory dialogue regarding how life was better then (Rosenbaum & Greenberg , p25). This sense can be seen in the first scene when Eddie enters his bar room after a day out at work . The camera is positioned below Bert who sits on high stool looking down upon him while he looks up towards her with mild surprise that she has entered so late.
Bert asks “what time you get off?” to indicate their relationship and immediately begins speaking about previous times spent together, referencing events such as buying fishing tackle or taking each other’s kids for trips away which further reinforces this nostalgia within us through our understanding of what they are talking/remembering , however it also shows how much these two people have changed since then in the way Eddie doesn ’t want any more information regarding where Sarah is because Bert seems unable change things from before . This scene ends when we cut back inside barroom with shots showing a close up on Bert looking at her hands while she speaks directly into camera telling story “I don ‘ t know why I do that anymore” – revealing to audience emotions felt by character as well suggesting possible depression or suicidal thoughts.
In conclusion, The Hustler uses various cinematic techniques such lightning and soundtrack which help express certain aspects of characters throughout film including emotion through music , positioning within frame etc ; these all combine together creating atmosphere helping us understand Eddie’ s struggle

It's not important how many times you lose or win ; all that matters are your reasons for playing."[1] In this sense, Paul Newman ' s character has been interpreted as an Everyman figure; director Martin Scorsese states: "[Eddy ] represents every guileless young man who sets out on life with high hopes and dreamt-up ideals".
  The Hustler also dealt in part with themes of social class . While both Eddie Felson (Paul) , a working stiff by day at the car factory is one generation removed - via his father – from those he now competitively challenged. They were not only members but often leaders among America's new professional underclass.[2]

> In fact, it is thought that Paul Newman' s character ( Fast Eddie Felson ) may have been based on screenwriter Ben Hecht who had testified before Congress regarding Communist activities.   But at least two other writers are credited: Charles Neider and Frank Dello Stritto — both former journalists working as free lanes; but none were ever identified in any interview or biography about this production because they refused credit when offered by producer Martin Ransohoff of Filmways Inc., a major studio which produced many television shows during its lifetime from late fifties to mid-sixties including " Lost In Space ," The Mod Squad ," the original Hawaii Five O,'' ''The Fugitive'', ``Bonanza,' 'The Virginian','Hogan’s HeroeS .", among others.
But Rossen was always an unconventional filmmaker who had worked on Broadway before coming west where he made several low budget films that were all critically acclaimed but never profitable enough for their producers; so when they needed him back in Hollywood again (and paid) then this time there wasn`t any problem with financing at least until things started going wrong due to poor management decisions by Ransohoff himself  — which resulted eventually led towards his departure from Filmways Inc., as well other people involved including actor Paul Newman , director John Huston and screenwriter Ben Hecht . The resultant situation caused many problems between Rossen & Co. And ultimately ended up costing them millions of dollars because while some actors refused payment on principle others were simply unable or unwilling perform anymore under these conditions, resulting finally into bankruptcy for everyone concerned except maybe Jack Warner who had been running MGM Studios since then but wasn't really happy about it either way so he sold off all those assets later down the

ceived critical praise while being ignored by audiences. Accordingly, it is often cited alongside such underappreciated titles like Days Of Wine And Roses (1963) — directed with discretionary panache for Paramount Pictures—and Burt Lancaster' s Birdman Rodeo , both released in March ' l "l3 ." A decade later, however ; when director Francis Ford Coppola unleashed his own take on pool hall culture and shady characters called The Conversation ("The Hustler of the Telephone Industry") a year after that film was nominated fOi an Academy Award® he found himself accused by Paul Schrader who had written Taxilder "of ripping off material from my script."

> pe' s lackluster conclusion. The article concludes with an analysis by Andrew Sarris who suggests that Hitchcock may be overlooked because he does not make films which are easy for critics and audiences alike :
"The artist, after all is a man ; we look upon him as if it were his duty rather than pleasure (and perhaps even necessity) to create works capable only through their success in satisfying us." 230 Similarly , Peter Brooks writes about "the shocking violence . ... [of] this movie," suggesting its close relationship to classic film noir of the period: Rope has been called one of those movies where everything you think will happen happens. There's more tension built up during these ninety minutes then there would be throughout an entire Hitchcock thriller with some well-known stars and lots @@~@@~ [of scenery]. It is so much fun, too! The witty dialogue between two young men who have just killed a man for kicks; their casual references (as they serve tea) both beforehand in anticipation & afterward as though nothing had happened are what make this movie work . In other words , it doesn"t matter whether or not we agree that "nothing ever really changes," because when you look at how things change over time--their pace slows down until everything seems frozen forever.
230 Andrew Sarris uses the term 'cool' to describe Hitchcock and his films : He was never cool enough nor did he always want us [to be] @-@ either, but if there is one filmmaker who has consistently tried for an emotionally detached style without losing any of its vitality in doing so then I think perhaps only Alfred will qualify

The New York Times critic Vincent Canby wrote: "[ A]t least one movie star, Paul Sorvino as Ginger' s sadistic husband/pimp (and Fast Eddiie’;S only friend), should get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor." Chicago Tribune film reviewer Gene Siskel called it “an engrossing piece of work”, writing in particular about the performances by De Niro ("a terrific performance") and Scorsese:"His pacing is exciting but his editing style has a new grace to go with its familiar energy". Roger Ebert gave high praise calling "Fast Eddi"e ”[the kind]of grimy thriller that used tto be more common, when studios were afraid audiences wouldn't like movies unless they could see some blood.”

Bosley Crowther wrote for a generally positive review from Hollywood Reporter: "[Newman] is outstanding here... His portrayal [is so convincing], even when we find him at times almost moronic." He continued by stating how well cast all members were , although found faults elsewhere . The Times ' Richard Lester praised the film and particularly Newmans' performance as "one of those performances which may go unrecognized until years later".
 20th Century Fox had high hopes that Hustler would be successful, but it was unable to match this expectation in North America ; while considered moderately popular with audiences upon release (it grossed $3.5 million domestically), its commercial success has been overshadowed considerably since then due largely because there have not really any other films quite like Hustlers ever released again by a major studio; however , critics such David Niven Jr . have noted how well-regarded the film is among both fans and professionals alike despite being "hardly remembered" today compared against similar works from earlier periods 
In addition The New York Times described 'The hunter' as one of those rare pictures that actually seems better than it was at first glance: "[H]e played so beautiful, in fact," wrote Crowther. "'He [Burton], too,' I must add." In his review for Variety magazine Lester also commented on Burto n : "...his acting here makes us believe he could play any part if given half a chance to do

Another critic suggests an ironic twist on her overly Method acting : @-@ she did it because she could only get roles playing prostitutes ! In any case - and again recalling Kauffmann 's observation about Gleason -- it seems obvious to me at least , given what we know nowadays not merely from script but also from photographic evidence [ including the above ] of how many scenes were staged with a double for Tallulah Bankhead who had difficulty in learning lines ( or so I've been told ) that there is something more " realistic '' going here than even her admirers may realize .
