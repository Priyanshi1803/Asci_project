> He nevertheless remained active in public affairs until shortly before death from illness brought on by extreme poverty.Du Fu's poetry, much influenced through contact with Taoist thought during periods when Zen Buddhism had not yet come into China ( cf Pure Land ), is known for its descriptions : scenes are presented as they occur without any attempt at interpretation or analysis; there is no abstract speculation about human nature but only observation ; there may be some commentary to provide context, such as the occasion that leads Du Fu to write his poem "Water Sound" , but this can usually be ignored and still leave a good understanding of what he was trying . His poems also often contain vivid images: in one famous example from 765 AD ("On Seeing Li Bai Drunk"), it says simply "the old pond / has turned into wine".Du's work covers many different styles. In addition are several shorter forms : quatrains (四行), triads or triplets (三句 ), couplet sonnets called jueju(诗曲) with four lines each, and even tercets made up entirely by three-character words which were very popular during the Tang dynasty itself but later fell out of favor because they lacked rhyme . There is also a form known as wodeci , where one line contains 23 characters; this was invented in an attempt to imitate Du Fu himself who had been writing poems containing exactly that number since at least his youth.The style adopted depends on both subject matter - some works are lightheartedly humorous while others deal more seriously with issues such as death or war ; it can be influenced too depending upon

They lived in Yueyang during Du Fu' s childhood , but moved several times due t o economic conditions that led his father into military service on one occasion , and then later because he became an official for Fan Zongweng, governor-general of Sichuan. The family eventually settled down near Wuzhong 武中 (now Chengdu) when Du was a teenager. His mother died soon afterward; by all accounts she played no role in shaping her son intellectually or spiritually despite having been literate herself* As part of the provincial administration under Tang Dynasty rule，Wu Zuo ordered the constructionof a new city to be called Guangling . In order t o attract settlers who would develop it into civilization , Wu invited talented individuals from other provinces and gave them free land there ; among those he recruited were many writers, including Du Fu himself.As an official , Wang Zhi 王志 (died around AD740) was one of several men responsible for rebuilding Chengdu after its destruction in war; this duty also included selecting people whom they thought could contribute something positive through their work or lives – such as poets like DuFu，who had already established themselves locally by then but needed encouragement before being able to move back home .

[ 3 ]The poetry collections that have been traditionally attributed (see below) may reflect some chronological order, but this has not always held true for later editions ; indeed there were several different orders used at various times in history because many texts did not survive over time due mainly from fires and natural disasters; this means much information about their original order was lost .

It also contained many biographical details about him including information regarding when he first began composing poetry under Emperor Xuan Zong 's reign , how old he became during that period etcetera...

The family suffered financial reversals at least once before Du <unk> 's early demise when Huizhou rebelled against Tang rule in 754 ; although Du Fu may have been too young for military service or other dangerous work during this period ( 12-30 years old ) it was a very difficult experience .In the year of Wu Zetian , Empress Dowager and ruling monarch from her usurpation to deposition by Emperor Xuanzong , he passed imperial examinations with honors as an official clerk after taking part only because his father insisted that all sons should be educated; however, no record exists about what happened next. He probably did not go on any further governmental posts until around age thirty when he began serving in county offices near Chang 'an under the name Du Yuan ("cassia" tree ).

A few months after failing, however, Li Bai visited him on an inspection tour through Anhui (which then included Huainan ) —this may have been as early as January or February 740 ; according one account by Du Fu's son Ruo Xu it happened again a couple years earlier while they were both serving under Governor Yuan Zhen near Huaian during the Tang Dynasty ' s campaign against Shi Chaoyi and other rebels in central China .In any case , this meeting led to their lifelong friendship : when Hung met with scholars from Beijing University who had come down south for summer vacation he told them that "Li Bai was not only my teacher but also someone I looked up too"—and those same words are still found on Li Bo monuments today.After failing his examination at age twenty-three (or so), Li Bai became an itinerant poet, traveling throughout Sichuan province where many of the great Tang poets lived during what is known as The Age Of Poetry Literature In Chinese History . His early works include “The Peach Blossom Spring” , written while living in Chang'an near Du Fu ; this piece has been called oneof China’s most influential pieces because its description remains relevant even after centuries passed since being composed by him himself ! Some critics believe that if not for these two men then there wouldn't be any modern day poetry left today—they helped bring back classicism into literature through their own work!In 753, Li Bai was appointed to serve under the Governor of Jiuzhen and Yuan Zhe.

> This was a period when there were few opportunities for promotion within government positions - mostly due, Chou argues, on account that both Li Bai (李白) and Wang Bo had recently passed their imperial examinations. As a result many officials chose instead tp become Buddhist monks or join religious orders ; Du Fu did neither although at this time it would appear he considered himself as much an artist-poet as anything else.### The final journey to Xi'an: "the most significant event of my life" (745–803)[1] [edit ]Du Fus final trip from Luoyang began in 746 , when after being promoted three times over five years, his position became too low for him . He resigned and set out on foot with two servants; their destination was the capital Chang 'An where they arrived sometime around October or November that year . Du Fu had previously visited China’s second largest city twice before but never stayed more than a few days at any one time - this would be different because he intended to stay there until retirement age unless something prevented it.The first thing upon arrival according to Shen Yinming's biography is how shocking Luoyi was compared back home in Huaiji , particularly since many people seemed unfamiliar with his poetry even though some of them were teachers who should have been familiarized already through other means like copying texts out by hand from books (which apparently wasn't always done). He spent most night alone writing poems, sometimes accompanied only my monks; when they weren’t prayers or hymns these works reflected Du Fu’s emotional state during those times .

The next few years were extremely difficult ones; although an able and hardworking official, many times over-zealous local officials conspired against him causing several charges made on accountable irregularities and misdemeanors such as failing basic military service ( "gong" ) or even embezzlement ("shou"). These events are well described in one letter Du Fu wrote after his release from jail: “I have been falsely accused by a malicious person who has wanted to see me dead for some time now…”In 756 , he was finally dismissed . At this point it is worth mentioning that the court had previously denied all accusations of any kind against him, but these could not be proved. He then moved with his family back home where they lived together at ease until around seven years later when they were forced once again out due to another famine caused by floods ( this time in Anhui Province ) and which led them on their travels across China as refugees from place-to-place looking for food - much like thousands others during those times who would eventually die en route or perish after having been captured as slavesIn a letter written while Du Fu was still alive , he said : "I have no idea what is going through my mind lately . I just wish that life will never end so i can continue living peacefully with all of you"   This clearly shows how devotedly loyal towards his family members were, especially when they had gone through such hardships together throughout many years.

This may have been one motivation to visit Sichuan again later on during the year - but he had also heard about the beauty of Mount Emei from other poets such as Wang Wei .

Soon the soldiers came and arrested those who had spoken against his order , as well as other officials such at Chen Boda ( 陳寶達 ) of Xichuan province ; these were sent back under escort towards Luoyang. When Li Jianxun was informed about this development, however, he decided to return home by another route instead; thus Zhang's victory over him remained incomplete . He then proceeded southward with a small band on foot through Qingyang county in Sichuan before heading east along Mount Hua into Henan Province where they crossed several times from one side across rivers or streams without stopping because there wasn’t any bridge available yet !<end poem>

During these years under Emperor Xianzong’ s reign between 845-859 AD , a new kind of poetry began to emerge and was called ‘ Poetry of Placidity ’ . This genre shifted from previous Confuscian normative forms towards an emphasis on emotions rather than ideology or rhetoric as its central focus.Du Fu is one such poet who exemplified this style; his poems often reflected upon nature, human life struggles within society at large including poverty stricken conditions for peasants living in rural areas during that period where there were frequent famines due too crop failure resulting from droughts caused by climate change phenomena like El Niño events occurring more frequently nowadays compared with past decades/centuries prior 19th century AD when Du lived (Sima & Tianbao). He also wrote about how political turmoil was affecting people’ s everyday lives negatively causing them much distress – something we still see today even though things aren't quite as bad yet since global warming began accelerating rapidly after World War II ended around mid-20 th Century last millennium ago before another major conflict broke out shortly thereafter known famously referred collectively among historians worldwide simply titled ‘War Of The Roses'.The Politics of China: From Mao to Xi Jinping.

His work is considered among scholars today to represent one aspect within Chinese literature: an individual who was not afraid nor ashamed when it came time speak out against wrongdoing by those in power even if they happenedto be related family members , friends etcetera.The best way I can explain how these poems affect me personally so deeply every single day because their meaning resonates with my own experience growing up : there's always something new happening around us whether good or bad sometimes both at once!

> found elsewhere" ; indeed it has been said that Du's own life was more interesting than anything else known from Chinese history.His work also reflects an unusual sensitivity for nature ( especially flowers) - both because, as a traveler through many parts if not all provinces at least as far northward into northern Manchuria ( Shanxi ) province [6] and central ShaanXi Province, his poems were written outside urban centers most often under natural surroundings- trees in parks or by streams; but he had studied the classical Confucian texts of China on their connections with the real world including , in particular : "The Book Of Songs" which was full of references to flora ; [7]. He lived much longer than other great Chinese literati who died young.He also wrote about love for friends, family members .During war years Du Fu found himself traveling from place to place while writing letters home as well as compositions that reflected these experiences - some poetic and others not so ( e g his ' Letter To My Wife' ). His poetry includes both personal notes reflective upon life and nature at a given moment or after-the fact recollections on past events. A good example is the poem he composed during one such trip "The Long Journey Home" which has been described by scholars in terms of its emotional tone , content & literary style :  [8] This song expresses loneliness, loss but also hopefulness; all conveyed through imagery from birds flying south for winter to people returning home with their loved ones .He was very much involved as an active participant within his own society ; not only did this give him perspective about many things including politics (which affected both high ranking officials and ordinary citizens alike)

> (Chinese:  道德观念; pinyin: dàodé guānlüàn, lit. 'moral viewpoint' or ‘morality perspective’), which has been defined by one critic as a 'methodological approach towards judging literature in terms not only literary but also moral values'. The term is intended to capture the fact that Du Fu uses poetry for social and political ends , often expressing his disdain at what he perceives are immorally motivated actions . This methodology can be traced back through the writings on Song-era poets ; it was particularly influential among later Ming commentators such as Wang Yun (1493–1582) who, while holding up Zhang Jiuling's 《贤妇》(The Wise Lady), a poem by Du Fu which condemns adultery, wrote: 'It has been said in past times "Song-poetry is not only literary but also moral". The poetry of this period [the Southern and Northern Dynasties] shows that the poet’s viewpoint had already reached an advanced level.' This methodology would continue to be used into modernity , when it was argued for example during the May Fourth Movement of Chinese literature :... if we consider Wang Anshi as our teacher (and he can indeed serve us well) then perhaps what should emerge from his teachings will lead us towards a return to olden virtues .  If we take Du Fu's perspective, however, then maybe such things are no longer necessary.   ... In other words: why go back? What is there in past times worth returning home again ? We have only one way forward – and that direction must necessarily include criticism! So criticise onwards !!! Criticism

> While Du Fu initially wrote only occasional pieces on themes such as food or drink ( see Food Poems ), these gradually became more numerous. From around AD1032, however, there is a clear shift in emphasis from abstract philosophic meditation towards personal reflection with particular attention paid both during times when feelings are strongest – e g after an illness - but also at other moments throughout daily life: " The Song-Dynasty poet Du FU was particularly fond [of] describing his own emotions through poetry , especially those that arose out of physical suffering ; this tendency has continued into modern China ."### Literature and philosophy : the influence on Li Bai 's work (AD958–7)Li's poems have been seen as marking one stage within a process which culminates in what is termed " compassionate literature ". This can be traced back to Confucius who believed strongly that it should not only encompass moral action but also express deep feeling towards other people. The latter part became increasingly important during later periods, leading eventually by AD1032/6 to Du Fu writing his own personal reflections rather than those of others . In addition , he often wrote about life events such as illnesses or death - sometimes even when there was no obvious connection with anything else happening around him at the time### Later poets and their work (AD97–14) : an overview from Yuan through Ming Dynasties until modern times"In recent years scholars have begun examining Chinese poetry in greater depths due largely because many works were lost after its earliest period but also because it became increasingly difficult during later periods for individual authors' voices not to be subsumed under a collective effort towards unity of purpose .

Du Fu did not write about love and romance like other Tang dynasty writers such as Li Bai or Wang Wei because he thought writing on those topics would be shallow; instead, he wrote more about the state of affairs at court during this time period—and even included political commentary! He is credited for creating new genres called <unk> , which are still used today by modern-day poet/songwriters in China to express their feelings towards society through metaphors that help them connect emotionally.

He also experimented with different forms such as folk songs or couplets which were considered by many contemporaries too difficult to comprehend - but later on became staples for Chinese poets from Li Bai through Meng Haoran down until the Tang dynasty itself; they would thus eventually earn him a reputation second only after that of Wang Wei among all poetic figures prior up unto then .In fact , it was not till well into modern times did Du Fu start being taken seriously again : his work is now widely regarded both within China and abroad alike, particularly in Japan where he had been highly influential since at least Meiji era. He has become one iconic figure who represents traditional culture during those troubled centuries when chaos reigned supreme throughout most parts if not whole country - yet still managing somehow manage find solace through creative expression even amidst such darkest days imaginable!

It is widely acknowledged that "the cult of [Du] has been more powerful than any single dynasty ... The first and last lineages are both immortal."

The classic study, _Wen xian tong bao_ (Critical Explanations for Everyone) by Su Shi included an essay written about twenty years before titled 'On Poetry'. In this he praised Li Bai and Du Fu but dismissed other ancient masters as being too obscure or difficult; many readers were thus introduced to them through him. He also wrote a collection of poetry himself which contained several poems modeled on those of his predecessors . This was followed in the 12th century by the first extensive commentary , _Xing sheng fu luo jin wen ji zhi quan fa yuan hou ju_ (A Collection Discussion Explanations Illustrative Notes on Allusions to Literature ) written by Wang Tao, who had been influenced both stylistically and philosophicaly .It has been suggested that these early influences led Chinese writers away from more sophisticated literary models towards simpler ones with lesser emphasis placed upon aesthetics. The influence is thought have persisted into later periods of history; for example Huang Zongxi wrote in 1672: "Aside the fact we can learn from Li Bai's poetry about his life or Du Fu's poems concerning how he lived during difficult times , I don’t think there are any other benefits to be derived".Wu Cheng 'en also used them as sources for his fiction, and they influenced such painters as Shitao .

One Direction rose to fame after finishing three of four categories in season seven . Their first single " What Makes You Beautiful" reached number one the UK Singles Chart , their second release hit #4 on Billboard's Hot Top chart while debuting atop both charts simultaneously and their third studio album Take Me Home went platinum within two weeks. They have also been awarded Best British Single by MTV Europe Music Awards for " Live While We're Young," as well as receiving a BRIT Award nomination under Pop Act category along with American Grammy nominations including Record Of The Year, Song Written For Visual Media (for song title) and Album/Mini-Album of 2013 .One Direction was formed in July during an episode from the seventh season audition process which featured twelve male contestants who had all previously competed on other reality shows such at Britain s Got Talent or X Factor UK where they were eliminated due to lacking enough votes. This group originally consisted Niall Horan , Zayn Malikand Louis Tomlinson but later joined by Harry Styles when he decided not compete for another show called Popstars:The Rivals after getting rejected twice beforehand because his voice wasn't powerful enough yet still wanted something else rather than just singing covers of popular songs like everyone else did back

> plan that would produce what became known as “Tokyo” type battleship s.The need to maintain parity with Britain in capital ships led Japan into building warships under license from foreign shipbuild ers for many years before it could build its own. The first such contracts were made during Meiji period when some German naval designs came out by way of a commissioner sent on an inspection trip through Europe and North America in late June / early July 1870, which included Germany’s Krupp steelworks . These were followed up later after the Imperial Japanese Navy was established officially at this time; however , they proved unsuccessful due primarily because there wasn't enough money available within government coffers or private sector funds raised overseas via investors who had no interest either directly nor indirectly into anything related specifically towards building warships for Japan itself - even though many did make donations anyway simply as goodwill gestures meant mostly intended more so than practicality purposes.The first contracted ship built under license from a foreign country that would be used by what became known then (and still is today) "the JMSDF" came about through an agreement between The United States Of America and Meiji Government back in 1872 called “Treaty Between Great Britain And Prussia For Naval Collaboration” whereby both nations agreed upon sharing naval technology , equipment & personnel across borders; however this proved difficult due mainly because neither party could afford anything substantial enough towards building warships let alone maintaining them once constructed - resulting instead into several failed attempts made over many years until finally something productive occurred within early stages of World War I when Japan signed its own separate treaty with Germany known as Treaty Regarding

The Japanese ships cost significantly more than the first three dreadnoughts built for Britain .The factories had produced very few capital warships since World War I and it was unclear whether they were capable enough to produce such advanced vessels or not because of the industrial stagnation suffered by Japan after losing WW-I . Consequently, when Admiral Abe ordered these new battleships he did so without consulting his engineers who were busy building submarines , destroyer s an d cruis ers as well as training naval aviators in preparation f o r any future conflicts with China which seemed imminent at that time. This decision would prove catastrophic later on during Operation Togo where Japanese forces faced off against American ones near Guam Island; ultimately resulting i n one hundred ships being destroyed due mainly to lackof quality control measures taken prior t o commencing construction while others simply weren't able meet specifications required by law because they hadn’t been properly designed or built beforehand either way there was no turning back now!

The upper conning tower was protected only on three sides as it would have been difficult to install a full-height shield since there wasn't enough space between the funnels so that they could be lowered without fouling each other ; thus any direct hit above this level might penetrate into either engine room or magazine if not destroyed outright .Yamashiro 's superstructure had an armor plate with varying degrees of protection depending upon location: gun turrets received mm while barbettes were covered in 150 millimeters (6 inches) thick plating; however these ships did lack torpedo bulkhead doors which meant no compartmentalization existed below their waterline making them vulnerable to flooding during attacks by submarines , destroyers, and aircraft carriers who would have been able locate weak points easier than before since they could now see through periscopes instead relying solely on radar technology as well as visual sightings .Yamashiro was launched first at Kure Naval Arsenal ; she had a long hull that curved upward towards the bow while her stern tapered downwards into an elongated transom housing four rudders (two each side).

The second ship had only been partially constructed when it received its replacement during refit in Kure Naval Arsenal between May -July Between March-May they also added another set to each side to operate three main guns per turret instead of just using elevators that limited how quickly she could fire them, as well as replacing their original twin anti aircraft mounts on deck behind bridge wings which caused problems due poor visibility while maneuvering at sea (they'd have less space available). This change meant there would be no room left over for more crew members either; however this wasn’t a problem because most were already being transferred off onto other ships by then anyway.Ise was laid down in 1920 and launched the following year .

> about sixty rounds per minute with a sustained firing period between eighty to one hundred shots.The prototype gun used the standard Bofors L /42 ammunition which had a high explosive shell weighing approximately six kilograms ; however these were replaced by armour-piercing incendiary projectiles for combat use in order that they would have better effect against lightly protected aircraft such as the Heinkel He , Arado A and Focke Wulf C fighter bombers, though it is unclear how much this actually helped since no aircraft other than medium or heavy tanks could be hit directly by any of them . In 1938–1940 trials with German manufacturer Rheinmetall AG proved unsuccessful when attempts to develop an improved version failed; further development was abandoned after just two prototypes had been built due largely because there were insufficient funds available at time despite efforts made towards improving performance through experimentation involving different shell types including those containing incendiary filler material as well explosives designed specifically for use against armour targets , but ultimately these experiments did little more than confirm what many already knew: that it would not work effectively unless equipped either solely or primarily intended purpose being anti-aircraft defence .Bofors 25 mm Anti Aircraft GunThe Bofors L/40 gun is a lightweight, low recoil naval artillery piece.

> also a factor but, for some reason , no other major navy built their ships this way until after World War II. This meant that there would be little protection if one or both magazines went off in an explosion although such occurrences had not happened during wartime use of these vessels by any nation up till then either( 1890 – WW2 ). It is hard today therefore to say how vulnerable they were because this type of layout did cause problems with the Ise class as well as later Japanese battleships and cruisers . The main battery turrets on all four classes could fire at a maximum elevation angle ( MLA )of +35 degrees while their secondary guns fired downwards only from -6.7 degrees, thus limiting them for engaging targets above or below eye level which was fine against ships but useless in combat with aircraft , something that became apparent during World War II when many US Navy warships had to fight off air attack alone after being left without help by other vessels( primarily due to lack of AA armament ). This situation would continue until the advent of radar which allowed accurate tracking even if there were no observers present .

In this scenario, Atsugi was expected to provide air cover until reinforcements could arrive : a role that proved highly demanding as it placed heavy strain upon already overworked aircraft which had been operating since late August without significant rest periods (the longest being seven days) . To make matters worse, shortages caused severe delays in receiving replacement parts and fuel for repair of damaged planes ; pilots complained bitterly regarding the lackadaisical attitude towards their welfare , stating they were "working like slaves" with little or no time off between sorties while others stated they felt nothing but contempt toward officers who did not even know what type plane was assigned to them nor where its maintenance records could be found !Despite these problems however , Atsugi proved a valuable asset during combat operations against Allied forces operating around Luzon. On December <unk> alone (while under attack from US submarines ) it launched over one hundred air strikes on targets in northern and central parts of that island .

This wasn't just because of good luck though; there were also several near misses between other ships like Yamato (which had been hit three times earlier) which resulted from friendly fire caused when planes shot down some enemy aircrafts that came within range for them to see over their own side lines.After the first wave, American pilots flew back home and landed on airfields located throughout Japan while Japanese fighters tried desperately at nightfall but with little success against these advancements until later in 1945 after more than two years passed by without any progress made towards winning this battle or war itself .

> ed after returning from its raid.The Imperial Navy had been very interested for some time in exploring ways that would allow it, at least theoretically, a chance against United States aircraft carriers (the USN's advantage over Japan being particularly pronounced) : by employing large numbers of specialized torpedo bombers — such as those carried aboard carrier-based floatplanes and shore installations equipped with catapult launch facilities , rather than conventional divebomber s or level bombing plan es which were ill suited to the task . The IJNAF attempted this strategy on several occasions during 1942–3 without success; an attack upon Pearl Harbor was planned but called off because it would have necessitated flying through a "kill box" that had been set up around Hawaii.On March, the Imperial Navy ordered its aircraft carriers into port for refitting while also planning another raid against Allied bases in New Guinea (Operation L ), using submarines as escorts ; however these plans came about too late and they never materialized , leaving only one group capable of striking at targets within reach : Operation M — which involved four carrier divisions: Zuikaku's First Carrier Division (Zuikaku herself plus Shōkakū), Junyō ' s Second Carriers Divisi on(Junyo ) a nd Hiyoku . This force would be accompanied by two battleships, three cruis ers an d twelve destroyers for protection from possible enemy interception or retaliation.The Japanese plan was to strike Allied bases in the eastern Solomon Islands as well as Port Darwin near Australia ; they also planned to bombard Sydney Harbour if it could not be avoided due t o adverse weather conditions which might prevent them reaching their primary target area before nightfall

On October 25th the British Pacific Fleet arrived off Okinawa and immediately began bombarding targets on shore with guns mounted aboard their battleships HMS Howe HMCS Haida plus several smaller vessels such as frigates etc. The US Fifteenth Air Force joined them soon afterwards providing further support through both day & night sorties conducted against Japanese positions across southern Japan where they were able destroy many warships including aircraft carriers , cruisers, submarines (which had been concentrated in this area) among other ships before finally moving onto Formosa itself by early November when American planes struck hard at airfields located there .In late October 1943 the first major naval battle of World War II was fought off Savo Island between an Allied fleet and a combined Axis force consisting primarily but not exclusively composed mostly outnumbered Americans.

> uarieswoodwork made of mahogany also proved durable. Most modern-day homes have aluminum windows instead, but some people still prefer hardwood or even metal frames for a more traditional look. A few years ago I saw an old house that was built sometime around World War II which used plywood as its exterior siding material—not something you’d see today! What kind is your home? Are there any unique features about it that make sense given when (or where) it was constructed ? 3 The first thing we should know before answering this question: what are the different types Of Buildings in Florida and how do they compare to one another In terms of design And construction methods . The most common type would be wood frame houses with brick veneer on top; however , many other styles exist including stucco/concrete block homes With flat roofs instead off pitched ones etc….. So let us begin by taking A closer look at each style so as not only To gain knowledge but also get inspired !Wood Frame Houses – These buildings typically have simple designs consisting mostly out o f rectangular shapes which can range anywhere between 2 story heights up until five stories high depending upon local codes regulating building size limits within certain areas (e.g., cities). Mostly built using lumber materials like pine trees cut down from nearby forests, these structures often feature wooden floors made of planks laid sideways across support beams running horizontally along walls . This type Of Building has been around since before America was even founded! Wood framing is still popular today because it’s relatively cheap and easy to construct compared with other types such as brick or stone masonry; however , some people may prefer one over another based on personal preference alone without any regard towards cost savings which

A trough associated with an upper-level low pressure area moving through Texas led to thunderstorm development across northern Mexico by late August as it tracked eastward into southern New Mexico, where severe weather occurred throughout much of midway through early September although rainfall totals were below average for the month overall due primarily to La Nina effects and dryness elsewhere around North America , including most areas from eastern Canada down toward Atlantic coastal regions in northeastern U S while California received unusually high amounts ; meanwhile a second system developed along Tropical Depression Nineteen over western Cuba on 15th day following that storm's arrival there earlier during same week period which brought significant flooding problems locally .Hurricane King was one such cyclone. It formed as an extratropical low pressure area near Bermuda before it transitioned into tropical characteristics late September, early October; by then the hurricane had strengthened significantly due to warm waters off Florida and North Carolina shorelines - particularly around Charleston Harbor where it made landfall with wind speeds estimated at upwards of $40 knots (~28 mph).

The UN command then devised Operation Chromite (Inchon Landings) wherein US amphibious landings were made behind enemy-held territory in orderto encircle and destroy Communist units before retreating back towards Pusan Perimeter again; this operation proved successful but at great cost since many troops had been lost during the process including those who died aboard ships sunk by North Korean torpedos or due too severe wounds received while fighting alongside South Koreans against their northern counterparts.  1950s, President Harry S Truman declared that his nation was not prepared for another war after World War II ended just three years earlier so he asked Congress if they could find any other way besides military intervention into Korea which resulted with them approving legislation authorizing deployment of US armed forces there under United Nations auspices (UNF) on July 7th , thus commencing Operation Ripper .

They also knew MacArthur's main concern remained defeating Kim Il-Sung rather than defending his position so he would not withdraw troops or risk any reinforcements being sent southward away from Inchon where a counterattack was planned for September 17th .In their preparation , they moved around two hundred thousand men to within striking distance of Seoul and launched three infantry divisions in massive offensives against X Corps at Masan on August twenty second followed by the Second Division attacking UN forces along Pohang, Kumhwa and Chipyongni , then the First Marine Brigade on Taegu. After initial successes these attacks were all halted as MacArthur's plans unfolded during Operation Chromite but it is estimated that about one-third of his combat troops had been deployed into a defensive posture while awaiting an expected counterattack .In order for their strategic plan to work they needed sufficient supplies flown over from Manchuria which was not happening fast enough so Kim Il Sung ordered them moved southward by train instead even though this would take twice as long at great expense in fuel with insufficient railways available and many bridges having already being destroyed after the capture. By late August, however , these trains were beginning to reach Seoul bringing much -needed ammunition , food and other critical items such that on September second all three of his divisions could advance again against UN forces now regrouping around Taegu following MacArthur's withdrawal northwards into Incheon .This time they did better than before but still met resistance from a U.S Marine Battalion holding Wonsan which was relieved by another group coming down through Yongsang under Colonel Arthur Dunn who

By mid-September, an attack by four battalions - three infantry companies plus a tank company – against Hilltop just outside Pohang became known as "The Big Show" because it had so many troops involved at once (US Army official history). The hill changed hands six times during this action . In all these actions and other small engagements along portions or segments if not most parts , if not whole sections only portrayed herein were North Korean forces able to hold US forces back using the advantages they enjoyed in numbers for the time being before pulling out again later on after having suffered heavy casualties themselves leaving behind dead bodies of theirs lying everywhere.In one engagement involving two companies from three battalions against a single enemy company, an estimated total strength of about five hundred men was lost by both sides according to National Geographic magazine's September '51 issue (US Army official history). The American side also reportedly had at least four tanks destroyed and several others damaged as well with many infantrymen killed or wounded during this fight which took place near Yongdang . In another battle fought between US forces under General Matthew Ridgway , who later became supreme commander allied powers Europe after World War II ended there were only twenty-five Americans left alive out 308 initially sent into action while North Korean soldiers numbered over one thousand on Augustine ridge alone resulting in an estimated loss ratio of more than ten to one against them due largely because they did not have enough time nor manpower available so their fire power could be used effectively until finally forced back by superior numbers from both sides (US Army official history).The Big Show was also known as "the

The commanding officer for all four companies was Captain Clyde Wise with his headquarters at Kokujinni [ Koyu Jinnee ] village just northwest off Changnyeon .The American forces were outnumbered by more than three times and did not expect an attack so soon after their defeat during Operation _Chromite_. According to General Edward M. Almond, commander of UNSCOM , "A great deal could have been done if we'd only known what they (the North Koreans) intended." As the South Korean 6th Division advanced into Masan on August 15 th , the US division commanders had no idea that this was merely a diversionary tactic for another major assault further south along Route #3 toward Pusan . The two divisions of X Corps had already pulled back from Naktong Bulge at dawn as part of yet one more withdrawal by UN forces in Korea.The task force attacking Changnyeon consisted mainly _of_ infantry and artillery units, with some support elements such as engineers attached to it during its advance through Nakdong River Valley up until mid-September when UNSCOM (the United Nations Command) would be forced into an ever retreating defensive line northwest around the city before finally being pushed out completely on September 20 th , after which all remaining US troops were evacuated aboard ship via Pusan .

The narrative of what happened during those fateful few months cannot be told in just 20 minutes - but perhaps we should remember that even though it was not until after WWII had ended did Britain finally emerge from its 'darkest hour'.The Battle for Korea began on June l3th when North Korean forces invaded South Korea (known as "Republic" ) along their border. After defeating Chinese resistance they quickly occupied Seoul which caused an international outcry because China refused to recognize any interference with or attack upon another nation's territory under Article VlIb1f)of the United Nations Charter . At this point , US President Truman sent a warning message saying if communist troops were allowed past Inchon then he would intervene militarily against them too - but it was already clear that UN Forces could not stop what had happened so far without risking war between America and its allies versus Russia/China themselves !The Battle of Korea is one of those rare conflicts in modern history where there are no "winners" on either side. The fighting ended after three years, leaving over 2 million dead from both sides as well many more wounded or missing persons due to battlefield accidents like landmin

It is noteworthy here, however, that while these higher commands understood what they wanted done with a task force type mission--to gain information about opposing forces' intentions by capturing personnel or disruptive action-they did not specify exactly how to do it and left tactical details largely up to subordinate commanders .Command post/communications center operations were frequently used as the basis for offensive patrols during combat on both sides in Korea. The value of such targets was well known among American officers who had participated in the fighting at Yongdungpo Bridge , Chipyongni where a U.N./U S 2nd Infantry Division patrol destroyed an enemy strong point (see Appendix B) On August 15, Major General Robert H Cannon, commander US X Corps commented that "We have learned from experience [in Korea] not only what can be done but also how it should best be accomplished." During Operation Manchu Lieutenant Colonel Harvey T . Riley and his task force would attempt to follow these guidelines for success against North Korean command posts/communications centers along their path of advance into suspected NK territory:* To gain information about the disposition , strengths and intentions of opposing forces by capturing personnel or disruptive action. - In order to obtain this type intelligence a patrol must conduct an offensive operation at night with no fixed route. The area covered is too large, terrain conditions are usually unfavorable (i e., jungle) making it difficult if not impossible in most cases ,to maintain contact between elements; therefore support from higher levels cannot be expected .

The South Koreans drove off some North Korean tanks ; however, two more tank rounds struck one man from B Co mpany deadly wounded him as he lay behind cover at point blank range; another bullet hit his rifle which exploded in fireball scatterin g shrapnel all around them both !In the days that followed there were several close calls when elements got separated during night attacks by enemy forces who had no idea what they looked like until daylight revealed their position on high ground . It was also important for units not to become too spread out or vulnerable themselves due 2 large number of men and equipment involved , but rather stay together tight formation allowing quick reaction times if attacked unexpectedly without warning. The North Koreans' tactic seemed simple enough: overwhelm UN defenders with sheer numbers then build pontoon bridges across river so vehicles could cross into South Korea where many civilians remained trapped behind lines still awaiting rescue attempt which never came thanks mostly because lack available transportation resources needed get them there safely quickly possible before winter arrived completely isolating entire country from outside world forever more!

At one point during this period each side had four battalions defending or attacking it within several hundred yards (meters) - US forces against South Korean ones as well as North Koreans . Later in that month however after additional reinforcements arrived most American troops were concentrated into two strong positions covering a frontage some eight miles wide while their opponents' strength was reduced to only three groups of between seven hundred and five thousand men by withdrawals westward towards Wonju Valley behind Naktong Bulge , leaving open an opportunity for assault on Hill  5 which would be taken over with little oppositionOn September the 29th, the regiment lost its commander Colonel John D.

In addition, General Ridgway's Eighth Army on Walker’ s right was not yet ready for battle ; its air units were scattered throughout Japan with no tactical control except that exerted by Admiral Nimitz from Hawaii through a process of radio communications. The Tenth Army command post at Taegu had been evacuated to Pusan . A combat commander without direct communication between his headquarters elements needed to be alert enough overnight @-@ perhaps more so than any other time during the day , especially if he expected trouble and might have reasonably anticipated it in advance . This was precisely what happened as well : Walker began receiving word about 03:15 on 2 September, while still trying tl~o reach Ridgway’s Eighth Army via airplane or telephone contact with General Almond who was then engaged in a battle of attrition against enemy forces holding positions northeast of Taegu. During this period, no one had sufficient information concerning NK activity northwest ojf Pusan to permit accurate assessment that would help him decide how best to use his combat resources for defense purposes; however , he received reports from the XXIV Corps sector that indicated some kind uf movement by the enemy . As far as Walker could tell at first light ~-' on 2 September and without any further confirmation ; it seemed likely tl~at Kim Il Sung’s main thrust might be directed toward Chinju or Masan (either port) in an attempt tI0 break out into a wide enveloping maneuver around his left flank, with possibly additional forces attacking Yongsang against which General Almond was already committed.

Oliver P Smith's III Amphibious Corp (IIIAC) against North Korean forces threatening Miryang city which may well turn into a trap because of its location within range from both sides; General Almond ordered his 2nd Infantry Division to take up positions along "Munsan-ni Ridge" just northwestward towards Osan Air Base, while waiting for them were two regiments plus some battalion strength reinforcements drawn mostly from other units such as artillery and engineers who had been stationed around Taegu before moving on southwards again .### Battle order: US X Corps vs. NKPA Army Group B & Chinese People's Volunteer Forces (CPVF) in the Naktong Bulge area at dawn [23 July] - afternoon of same day[19 August], 1950 AD/CE – Operation Chromite phase II underway : preparations completed; last-minute changes made to plan due to lacking information about enemy dispositions; Allied commanders confer over radio links with headquarters staff for final confirmation(s).

The battle at Agok indicated otherwise - an attack could well come in force down either road parallel to Rte.No._307_. This belief proved correct when a heavy enemy assault developed along these roads about midnight September I and continued until dawn next morning [September]2ndwhen the 9th Infantry's front line collapsed under pressure from three directions .In response , Colonel Craig ordered his command into action against this new threat as soon as possible-the 1st Battalion was directed toward Pukchin-tun, while he himself took A Company northward on Route #4 with orders to secure Yipa Ri first before proceeding farther (see Map F ). At approximately <unk> o'clock in the evening of August3lst, he received an order for a general advance by all forces along Rte.#_4_.

The North Koreans began firing artillery into Agak around noontime. At first they fired one shell every few minutes but later it was found that they were using large caliber mortars which could fire a salvo of eight or more rounds at once. This barrage continued for about half an hour after which time all quiet returned until 1900 hours when A-36’s position came in range o fthe Naktong River again - this time from Yukdungni (35°48'N,l27 °E) and Changyon(CJ6 ’F). The North Koreans immediately opened up with small arms , machine guns , antiaircraft weapons and artillery . At nightfall the KMAF had to withdraw their position below Agak on account of enemy shelling but by that morning they were back atop the ridge overlooking it.

As these two battalions had been reduced by fighting with North Koreans or drowning while attempting a river crossing they could not prevent further withdrawals of South Korean forces during darkness , which led up until midnight when North Korea launched an attack to recapture the Han River bridgeheads that had fallen earlier in the day as well as cutting communications links . This time most units fought back effectively so only one regiment managed to reach their side of Naktang before morning.On Saturday August 19, South Korea’s division headquarters at Chinju was attacked from four sides and captured within half-an hour after a furious fight (5). The battle for Kumhwa-ni continued through Sunday but by nightfall there were no more than two battalions remaining with few weapons or ammunition left , which could not stop further withdrawals into Songnimdong during darkness until they too collapsed under enemy pressure on Monday afternoon leaving the Han River crossing in North Korean hands . In total about three thousand men had been lost while fighting to hold this area ; many of these would be taken prisoner.By August 20th South Korea’s forces west of Naktang numbered only around fifteen hundred and remained without artillery support because their own guns had either run out or become drowned when trying crossings (6). Withdrawing overnight after dark was no longer an option so those who survived formed a defensive line between Hwachon Lake at its southern tip near Wonsan , which ran northward past Songnimdong until it reached Kumhwa-ni where they were joined by remnants from elsewhere .

In addition , seven other American troops who tried to rescue survivors of these battles also lost their lives. All told, almost half the original strength had been destroyed during this withdrawal by August 23 : "Most members did not surrender because they feared retribution from Korean civilians if captured alive."

It is believed that at this time there were no more than two or three thousand troops defending both sides; however many times as much again could have been concentrated behind them if they had needed to be called up quickly against an expected American attack through Songchu Pass (which never occurred).A study by Captain Telford Taylor shows that when Task Force Manchu made its attempt , it suffered only about half of the casualties sustained in other attacks during the same period . These losses are largely attributable to friendly fire which was unavoidable because of fog and a lack o f knowledge on part either side concerning where their own forces were located. There is no question but what these men did heroic work, with all odds heavily stacked against them; yet there seems little doubt from this record - and others like it-that they could have been more successful had better planning gone into preparation for such an operation as opposed to relying upon existing plans developed under entirely different conditions at another time.```

Walker also asked about airlift capability in Korea , saying that if a major offensive were launched against him, it might take five days even with all available transport aircraft working around t h e clock just to get one regimental combat team into place (Ibid., pp. A725 -A749).General Hickey replied by describing the situation near Pyongyang . He said the ROK 6th Infantry Division had been surrounded and was now trying desperately for relief but so far no help could be given because of lack of supporting equipment such as artillery ammunition and vehicles which would have made possible immediate commitment on both sides in Korea [of US Army forces]. General Walker agreed that reinforcements should not come from Japan until there were some available aircraft to support them; otherwise they might simply add another burden rather than relieve pressure at Pusan (Ibid., pp. A749-A753).When Major Hickey ended his conversation with General Omar Bradley, the Far East Commander , he reported back by telephone what had been said about K-21 . He described a new enemy attack against K 60 where two ROK regiments and one American regimental combat team held ground west of Chunchon and northwestward toward Hamhung which was being pressed very hard [and] that it seemed as though an additional division would be needed in Korea to stop this offensive from getting through; moreover there were only six battalion landing teams available for airlift (Ibid., pp. A753 -A89).General Walker expressed agreement with General Bradley's proposal to dispatch the US Marine Corps ,

He did not send reinforcements until after midnight and they were too late; moreover, these units arrived piecemeal without adequate preparation or cohesion which led to their being shattered by American firepower before reaching any point near " Pork Chop ". Still worse for him - perhaps even more serious than this in its implications-was that no effort whatever had been made earlier during those same two days of September fifth through seventh against the 23rd Infantry 's perimeter .This failure on Cho' s part was quite understandable , since his entire force (the NKPA) at this time numbered less than twenty thousand men compared with our own strength of one hundred and eighty five thou. sand ; moreover, he knew from experience how badly his troops fought under pressure; however it is true also that neither did MacArthur nor any other Allied commander have such a decisive superiority over

The losses sustained by this unit were so great it forced their retreats in some places due simply to lacking sufficient personnel or equipment! In other words they could not continue fighting effectively because too many people died during these battles as well. It is important also remember why there was such high casualties; mostly caused from being attacked continuously throughout everyday without rest between attacks resulting into major fatigue problems among soldiers etc., thus making them vulnerable against enemy fire power even more than usualAftermath and lessons learned:The battle of 23rd Regiment vs NK 1st Division has been cited time again for its tactical importance . Although, the attack by North Korean forces failed in this particular case , it shows how a determined army can overcome any obstacle that stands before him with proper planning & execution ! In addition to learning about warfare strategy during WWII era history buffs may also find out interesting facts such as who won/lost which battles? How many people were killed / wounded ? And so on.

The second phase also saw heavy fighting around Wonsan October-November , with Chinese forces making several attempts (in particular Operation Maple Leaf ) to break through UN lines during this period and capture port facilities. However these efforts failed due largely to American air support as well as poor planning by China who had not anticipated strong resistance or prepared accordingly; moreover reinforcements arrived too late after delays caused mostly by weather conditions such rain storms causing muddy roads thus slowing down supply convoys while at same time preventing planes taking off/landings so many attacks were canceled altogether ...... The war came close but did not end in a military victory for either side, instead resulting only partial success . It has been noted that there was no clear winner , because neither the UN nor North Korea achieved its objectives during this period.

On November 17th General MacArthur issued orders reorganizing I Corps under Major-General Hobart Ramey (see appendix F). This was done to place three infantry regiments in one division with support units all together at once—to ensure the best possible use would be made if there should ever come an occasion where such troops had to fight on foot or otherwise without motorized transportation and tanks . Furthermore , he ordered that these new divisions were ready by December first.On October twenty eighth, President Truman sent a letter of reprimand directly over McNamara's head stating : "I have been informed through you Mr Secretary that our forces are now about seventeen miles from Seoul ... If this is true then it has taken us eight days longer than we expected." This was not only embarrassing for MacArthur but also showed how little control the president actually exercised in direct command authority during wartime as opposed with his usual role which had him acting solely within domestic politics ; especially since most important decisions regarding strategy would be made behind closed doors by General Marshall .On 12 July, US troops captured Taejon , South Korea and on August third they began their advance towards Pusan where they met stiff resistance. In September an armistice agreement between North Korean forces (the Soviet Union) were signed at Panmunjom after many months of negotiation; this ended hostilities until June twentieth nineteen fifty-three when both sides resumed fighting again in what is now known as "The Second Battle Of The Imjin River".

> 3rd rate cruisers ( a large number built, but not used much ), protected corvettes / frigates which could escort other vessels or act independently ; armoured floating batteries intended solely for shore bombardment; battleships protecting fleets from enemy ships and monitors acting like riverine gunboats. The first two categories proved too slow compared with sail-powered ironclad rams such as USS New Ironsides and HMS Monarch so they soon disappeared while the latter had no use in combat against seagoing warships by the end of World War I .In most navies , however 19th century ironclads were classified according to size : "large" ( ~3,050 tons ) / medium sized ("second rate") about half that weight ; small or third rates under one thousand long tons displacement . This was due primarily because these ships usually lacked armour protection over their machinery spaces which made them vulnerable during naval actions even if properly manned with skilled crews. However some very fast and heavily armed designs such as HMS Royal Sovereign existed along side other types including light frigates used by the United States Navy for coastal patrol duties until they became obsolete after 1874 when sail-powered ironclads were introduced into service; in addition there are records of smaller vessels built especially to protect harbours from enemy attack but otherwise having little or no military value at all .The first true "armoured cruiser" was launched early on January 26th,2035 (sources vary). This vessel had a wooden hull clad with steel plating and fitted out primarily for long distance voyages. It could also serve as an armed merchantman during times of war if necessary

> isticated propulsion systems for ship's machinery, and better means for defeating armored ships with explosive shellfire.The first true "iron" cladding came about as a result from an accidental fire on HMS Warrior during her fitting out period: The deckhouse caught alight which caused damage to both hull plates. When they were replaced it became clear that replacing them would require removing all rivets so a new method was developed whereby two sheets could be placed together overlapping by 1/4 inch (6 mm) without the need of any fasteners at all; this technique is known today as hot bending or cold rolling . This process also allowed for thicker armor than previously possible due its increased strength compared with other methods like wrought iron , cast steel etcetera but there are still limitations on how thick an individual plate can become before buckling begins occurring under stress from enemy fire which limits design choices somewhat although modern techniques have overcome these problems allowing plates upwards off six inches thicknesses depending upon their application requirements such military vehicles tanks trucks etcThe development was further advanced by HMS Dreadnaught, launched in 1906. She had a low freeboard and shallow draft (24 feet) to allow her access into ports that were too small for larger ships . Her main armament consisted of ten breech-loading guns mounted in five turrets: two forward , three amidships with one on each side , plus another located atop the bridge structure; all firing Armstrong - Whitworth rifled caliber shell ammunition weighing about 38 pounds per round projectile traveling @@ speed upwards off four miles per second ; these weapons could be loaded quickly thanks largely due their being arranged around

> types, such at battleships with heavy guns designed for long-range battle against other capital ships began appearing. While these new vessels retained some characteristics associated with earlier forms (such has armour), their role had changed completely from what was expected when an "iron" ship first appeared in service around fifty years beforehand..## History and development: First designs through World War I era developments, 1756–c. 243AD) The earliest recorded attempts to make warships using metal were made by a Dutchman named Simon Stevin during the late sixteenth century; however , no evidence survives of any actual construction . It is likely that he simply described ideas for future use rather than having actually built anything. In his work De Vrieswyk van Waterloopen (The Artillerymen's Companion), published posthumously circa 1680, Frédéric de Jolliet stated "the guns in these ships would be all iron and bronze".There are few details known about early armoured ship designs but it appears they had little or nothing on their sides other than thin plates as protection against cannonball fire from enemy vessels which were often made out to sea at anchor , where the ball could not penetrate them . The British frigate HMS Dreadnought was commissioned into service by Admiral George Anson during his expedition of discovery around Cape Horn (also called 'The Great Circle Route') between March-June 1740. In addition, she carried several smaller wooden boats for transportation purposes; these included a dinghy named after her captain who led this voyage - Captain James Cook's ship Resolution being one such example amongst others listed below:### Predecessors and developments in early warship design before ironclads began to be built from

> 3 features are combined that we have an 'iron cladding' with which modern historians agree ". Some ships built before this date, such as HMS Warrior or La Gloire were known for their durability during combat but did not meet these specifications at least one key feature was missing from them: they could be sunk by gunfire alone because the steel plate protecting their wooden sides proved too thin to resist heavy naval artillery.The earliest ironclads typically had wood-and -steel hulls , and later designs included full metal casings . The first armored warships ( such as Spanish Reina Christína ) were wooden vessels that used thick plates of wrought  iron protected with boilerplate sheet copper . Armor in this form appeared on many pre–Iron Clad era ships, including HMS Warrior ; but it is not true armour since there was no metallic lining between these individual elements; instead they formed an outer shell over a standard ship's structure without any significant increase to its strength or durability.The need for protection against gunfire led directly from the American Civil War when USS Monitor and CSS Virginia battled each other at Hampton Roads (also known as Battle of Ironcladd) , which ended inconclusively due mainly because both sides lacked sufficient range with their weapons so neither could shoot down much more than halfway across river mouth before having too close quarters combat . This forced them into small engagements where only short-range guns were effective making naval artillery obsolete on these new types vessels until long after World  II had begun; but even then they still remained vulnerable during nighttime hours while most warships operated under lights out conditions.The first armored ship was HMS Warrior, launched in October  1860 and commissioned December 23

Naval historians have debated whether or not ironclads could ever be considered "true" fighting ships given that their main armament is generally land guns mounted in an open casemate rather than atop gun decks like those found aboard most frigates and other types of warship.### Steam propulsion and auxiliary power = [Steam_propulsoin] 2016/7/3 edited by zhangzhicheng@163 .com ==[=][ ]==

The successive experiments led by Engineer Captain Hennessey demonstrated how effective these new weapons could prove when used against fortifications, but also showed some problems with stability under fire from shore batteries : they were not able at full speed above ten knots of wind . At first, it seemed impossible for such small boats weighing only about thirty tons each being propelled on a water surface to resist any cannonballs fired over two miles away and projected towards them @-@ 1856 , the French had completed five armored floating battery - one in 203mm RML ( Royal Marine Light ) ; three others armed as blockships. The French Navy wanted twenty more guns by year end; however naval warfare remained tactically static during this period because both sides feared attacks from these new vessels while they were still vulnerable at sea.In order that ships might be protected against gunfire, it was necessary for their hull form or constructional features not only adequately but also efficiently to meet all conditions imposed upon such protection . It followed therefore logically enough when we came across any of those forms which appeared capable of meeting the various requirements , and which seemed likely under favourable circumstances even if greatly exceeded in power than had been previously attained with our existing types-that as a result thereof we should proceed without delay towards an experimental type having some resemblance thereto ; so far indeed did this reasoning take us on one occasion (i.e., during July 1854) that His Majesty's Government decided immediately after receiving notice from their French Allies concerning certain plans for ironclad floating batteries, etcetera - not only to adopt them but also at once commence construction upon five such vessels within six months!

They also had higher freeboard on their hull sides (upwards of ten inches more) and weighed several hundred tons heavier , although this was offset by being armed only as lightly armed ships rather then the heavily equipped French ironclads which could be manned by fewer men due in part because they used steam propulsion instead of sail powered vessels like most other navies at that time.The first two British armoured floating batteries, HMS Inflexibleand Invinciblewere completed with a barbette gun turret mounting 90-pounder muzzle loading smooth bore cannons .

The first true armoured ironclad ships came into service on both sides during this conflict - Armada and Amerigo Vespucciwith each side introducing new designs over time that led eventually to the more familiar "turreted" style of warship built between around 1870-90. In Britain , the Royal Navy's HMS Warrior was one such design from this period (and in fact it predated her sister ship Iron Duke ). They also influenced French naval thinking, leading directly or indirectly to a number of other experimental types like Amiral DuperréLamartine    and Plongeur . By contrast most German ironclads were not designed with turrets at all - instead they relied on fixed armament mounted as part of their hull superstructure which limited them tactically compared against those armed ships that did have revolving gun platforms installed aboard; this includes SMS Kronprinz  , who had been built without any guns because his designers believed there would be no need for such weapons during peacetime operations.

While the inner layer was coated with a protective paint or primer it still contained air bubbles which would cause cracks and weak spots over time if exposed regularly under heavy stress loads from impacts etc. However these were not necessarily fatal flaws given that most navies did little more than provide occasional maintenance checks between major refits; this allowed for some degree flexibility in terms how much damage could be taken before repairs became necessary ( although sometimes warships had been lost because they simply ran out steam ).The designers @-@ who worked on Warrior understood both issues perfectly well , so rather then just using iron plating around her hull .

The other two vessels were less formidable : the _Merrimack_ and another smaller vessel known only as "the first Louisiana" whose armament consisted mostly of short-range smoothbore guns mounted on revolving turrets with little protection below waterline against enemy fire; these ships would not see action until later in 1862 when they met up again near New Orleans .The war began early April , but no major engagements took place between ironclads before May ; this was because both sides initially concentrated their efforts on building new types that could carry more heavy artillery while having better protection from hostile gunfire. The U.S., for example, built sixteen wooden monitors (later known collectively as the _Western Gulf Blockading Squadron_ ) armed mainly by long-range rifled guns and protected only with armor plating around key areas such as turrets or engine rooms; these were designed primarily to attack

The next year saw several notable engagements between armored vessels of both sides: in March Merrimack destroyed Congress (which had been converted from frigate Congress ) and Minnesota . In May Alabama defeated Kearsarge with a successful ramming attack, but soon thereafter the former's crew mutinied to prevent further fighting against merchant ships , while Cairo broke through Fort Donelson 's defenses during its capture by Federal forces ; at least one other ironclad was captured intact. During 1863–4 the CSS Arkansas played an important role on Mississippi River battles as it fought four Union warships without significant damage or loss; she also raided Baton Rouge in January of that year before being disabled for repairs due to mechanical problems (which led her surrender).In early July Confederate Navy engineers were able complete construction and launch a new armored ship, Alabama .

He was proven wrong, as his gunners were unable to damage her with their small guns; she soon took part in an attack against the city before being transferred northward where ironclads would be more useful . The most famous naval battle during 1864 came around October , resulting from efforts by Union Admiral David Glasgow Farragut ; after running past Forts Jackson and St Philip near New Orleans (both built just prior), then capturing them both using a fleet composed largely or entirely by iron-hulled vessels such uptil now only existed within wooden hull warships .The first true battleship was constructed at the end of this period: USS Puritan, launched on November 29th that same year. She featured two gun decks instead than one like previous ships in order to improve firepower; however it would take until late April before she could be used effectively during combat due mainly because her engines were still undergoing testing process which prevented any sort ship maneuvers other than simple steering directions towards target area while firing artillery weapons downrange from bow deck level position onto enemy vessel(s) located further away outside range limit capabilities given by design specifications provided prior installation completion date .The ironclad revolution had changed naval warfare forever and made wooden-hulled vessels obsolete , but many navies continued building them for years after this event took place.

Some historians also question whether any serious damage could be inflicted by such weapons as opposed to high explosive shells or solid shot at long range; however these guns were rarely used in action because of concerns about excessively shaking up an unarmoured ship's structure and weakening its hull plating, which would render it vulnerable even when no direct hit occurred.

Thereafter, most major navy's built armored ships that could engage other types such cruisers or monitors but not sailing frigates (unless they had specialized engineers to rig them). All this changed when HMS Dreadnought was launched with her revolutionary design: she introduced several innovations including a uniform main battery caliber instead all different sizes which made for an unprecedented level firepower , turrets as opposed to individual guns in casemate batterys mounted fore-and -aft . The latter allowed more effective broadside firing than traditional muzzle loading weapons did; furthermore it enabled the ship commanderto place his entire available force into action at once rather than having only one third of each side ready while others were loaded or aimed, thereby greatly increasing both offensive and defensive potential.## See also

> onnage as vulnerable as ever before, it seemed logical to assume - despite numerous experiments with breechloading artillery at sea during this period &mdash;that cannon were obsolete ; so much attention was given instead towards developing new types of rams capable not only inflicting damage but also sinking their targets outright (the " crusher" type ) or simply breaking them off by pushing through a crack between two pieces into an engine room filled with waterThe British Navy adopted ramming tactics in earnest after its defeat in the Battle of Lissa . During that battle , which took place on July 20th and September thirteenth, eighteen ships from each side clashed for nearly six hours. The Austrians won decisively as they defeated eight Italian vessels at one time during this period; however there were some instances where both sides suffered heavy casualties due to being hit multiple times while attempting various maneuvers such as turning around quickly enough so their opponents couldn't follow suit (which usually meant going straight towards them). Despite these losses though none resulted directly because someone had been trying hard enough against another person but instead happened through collisions between different boats fighting over space .In the late nineteenth century , naval tactics moved away again with a renewed focus on armor and artillery, although many ships still carried rams. The last major battle fought by two fleets of ironclad warships was at Tsushima in 1905 where Russian cruisers used ramming to good effect until they were sunk or destroyed themselves after suffering heavy casualties due largely owing their lack thereof compared those who possessed them well beforehand during other battles like Manila Bay (1898).

> actical concepts based on this belief shaped much Anglo-American thinking in warship design during those years.### The battlecruiser controversies (early twentieth century) In some cases, such as HMS Dreadnought , they carried enough weight of gunfire and speed sufficient for them all but ignore their opponents' defensive firepower. The use of these vessels in a tactically aggressive manner was often justified with claims concerning superior offense or defense compared to battleships .  At times both sides would claim that ships were more heavily armed than one another even if the same weapons systems had been used by each side’s navy since before World War I; this may be seen from British statements about German armor-piercing shells at Jutland (1916) when it turned out that no such shell existed, although some heavy cruisers did have guns capable firing them and, according to naval historian Norman Friedman , “the Germans could easily have developed a special purpose projectile for their new superdreadnought Bismarck” but chose not to.* The Battle of Tsushima in 20 May was also an example where battleships were destroyed without using torpedoes or ramming . In the early years after World War I navies tended towards capital ships with long-range artillery duels being fought by all types of warships at extreme range; as well there is evidence that German battlecruiser plans existed during WWI which would use weapons similar (if not identical)to those carried on British and Japanese dreadnaughts, although it remains unknown if these vessels actually existed outside conceptual stage .

One ship which used them with devasting effect was Admiral Scheer ' s battlecruiser SMS Derfflinger of World War I vintage. She carried four guns in twin turrets, each one equipped to fire a shell upwards at the same angle and range; when firing these it could cover almost half of any horizontal circle around her with deadly explosives : "Derflinger's guns were so heavy that they couldn’t be moved by hand".In addition there are many types , including rifled breech-loaders (a form largely confined to coast artillery) ; bolt action weapons which can operate without reloading after every shot because their bullets have time fuses attached .

These issues prompted naval authorities t o recommend that they be replaced by better designed models.The first major step toward muzzle - loading rifles was taken when Britain's HMS Devastation (1870) and Warrior launched in 1864 carried six of Armstrong ' s new "Rifled Breech Loading" guns made up from a combination of both smoothbore cannons as well as some with a bore diameter less than one-inch long, each mounted alongside another type having an even larger barrel length than their counterparts which were over three feet deep inside . By contrast , the French ironclad Gloire had four smaller caliber bores measuring just under eight inches on her main battery ; however this did not prove problematic because she could still fire at targets without being hit by return shells due to its size advantage against enemy ships.### Early use in shore

If they had been loaded by a separate loader rather than being operated like small arms this would not have happened so often as he could then take care that his hands did no touch any parts inside or outside t!he barrel before closing it ; but since these weapons are more complex and expensive to produce because their rounds must be made up specially for each shot, such precautions cannot always be taken , 37 The recoil forces used in automatic fire can cause damage to both weapon itself and gun crew . In addition when firing into battle at close range shells which do penetrate the enemy tank may explode on impact with its interior armor where they will endanger everyone within; even a small number of hits like this would have disastrous results. This problem is aggravated by the fact that many tanks were still fitted witih an open turret - as was considered essential until ~0 since it provided better all-round vision ; these could not, therefore, take shelter inside their own vehicle or behind some other obstacle if fired upon from any direction , 38 These considerations are sufficient to explain why in the first years after World War I most nations decided against using automatic weapons for infantry support and limited themselves instead to manually operated guns .In practice however it became apparent that with every year passing increasingly powerful artillery shells began being used which meant larger caliber barrel bores; a gun of sufficient strength had soon become necessary. In addition there were many occasions when an enemy tank was spotted at long range before its crew realized they too would be seen ; under these circumstances, unless he wished his vehicle destroyed by fire without having been able t!o return any shots himself , the best option is usually simply not engage in battle until closer quarters can again be reached

The design was known as BL .These heavy coastal artillery pieces, coupled to long range breeches and large charges meant that they could be loaded while still within close combat distance ; although this often proved too slow for some crews who preferred rapid reloading over the accuracy inherent in larger charge sizes ( which required more time ). However these ships had only limited armour protection against shellfire; their main weakness being a lack of top-weighted guns firing at low angles due to weight considerations — something corrected by later designs such as those built around 1890/2 when British warship construction began using all steel hulls .The BL was an entirely new concept compared with previous naval artillery systems , since it used rifling instead off smoothbore barrels that were prone towards ricocheting shots or bursting on impact because they could not sustain sufficient pressure inside the breeches. This problem did eventually be resolved through improved design techniques but only after many years spent experimentation and testing during which time several prototypes had been constructed before finally reaching production levels suitable enough for use aboard ships at sea !

However, British and German ships at the time adopted crude early forms of turrets to mount their main batteries , but these proved too slow in operation due to poor design and constructional weaknesses. The Royal Navy then built HMS Dreadnought ( 1906 ) with one of several designs that revolutionized naval warfare by introducing a new generation protected dreadnaught battleships armed with all-big guns ( BBG ), firing explosive armour piercing shells ; this was soon followed up by other navies around the world . In addition they also mounted torpedo tubes as part deterrent against submarines - the first aircraft carriers were converted from obsolete cruisers because their main batteries could not be carried in them , but these proved too slow and expensive compared to more conventional vessels such as battlecruiser s which had been designed specifically for speed. The advent of radio communication made possible rapid communications between ships at sea, allowing commanding officers on board warships or shore bases direct control over artillery fire via wireless signals sent back through channels opened when needed; this became known informally among naval personnel simply 'talking with shells'.The British Navy was still building its battleships during World War I .

This type had been pioneered when Sir William Armstrong built "Long Tom" (also known at times, for reasons not clear from me) - originally named 'Bessie' after Queen Victoria's daughter Beatrice - to fire shells over long distances across waterways into land targets; the first one fired in September 1859 was based near Newcastle upon Tyne on the River Tyne. The next step came just three years later as he modified his design so that it could be moved by a steam-powered tugboat onto locations further afield and then reassembled using screw jacks which would raise or lower each section of its metal frame according to requirements: this allowed them both stability when being used during combat operations but also meant they were relatively easy for people working with heavy machinery like cranes at docksides etc.,The barrels themselves ranged from around two feet long up until about four foot lengths (1 metre).  In addition, there was another type called 'Little Bessie' whose gunbarrel measured just under one meter in length. The muzzle velocity varied depending upon whether it had been fired off a shore-based platform; however even so high as 30 degrees C would be reached if the weapon did not have enough power to propel its projectiles more than halfway across water before impacting against whatever target lay beyond these limits - which could sometimes result into fire damage due excessive temperatures causing structural failure within materials such wood etc.,### Second World War and postwar period (1945–present) – United Kingdom, United States

A ballistic coefficient is an index that compares the shape to other shapes, usually spheres, which are known for their drag characteristics.. For example: If you want your bullet design's BC = BCSphere * X where "X" represents some factor of improvement over sphere - then you could use this formula to calculate it ...Heavier bullets have higher sectional densities than lighter ones due largely because they contain more metal by weight; therefore heavier projectiles travel faster while flying through air at similar velocities (and distances). This makes them ideal weapons when accuracy isn’t essential but penetration power matters most—such as with hunting rifles or sniper shots taken from long ranges away! The 150-grain .378 Lapua Magnum is the standard bullet for target shooting, and can be loaded into a wide range of cartridges. It's also used in some varmint loads like Hornady Varmints & Predator ammo to deliver high velocity downrange without excessive recoil on lightweight firearms such as AR platforms..The 24" barrel had an overall length (OAL) of about five inches shorter than any other gun available at that time period due its unique design features including interchangeable chambers which allowed multiple calibres or projectiles from different manufacturers within one weapon system! This was accomplished by adding two grooves around each chamber so they could be adjusted quickly during combat scenarios when needed most; thus making this rifle extremely versatile for military operations worldwide because it offered greater flex

Steel was easier to machine but it had the advantage that if a shell hit one end , most of the energy would be absorbed by deformation rather than deflection, as happened when iron plates were struck at an oblique angle. It is reported some armourers deliberately aimed their guns slightly higher in order not damage them so much; this might explain why early warships' hull sides tended towards flatness and verticality (see clipper ship). The developmental stage between smoothbore cannons firing solid shot with black powder propellant and rifled muzzle-loading or breech loading weapons using explosive charges was known variously as transitional artillery .The introduction of steam power allowed the size of vessels to be increased beyond what could have been handled by sail alone, but it also introduced new vulnerabilities. Steam turrets were considered more reliable than gunpowder ones , due in part because they did not need time for their guns to cool down after each discharge; however some types suffered from problems such as spalling (fragmentation) when shells hit them at certain angles  or even just hitting a plate with sufficient force might cause catastrophic failure . Another problem is that while water-cooled cannon are better able cope with repeated firing over longer periods without damage compared against conventional muzzleloaders which require regular

> izable with increasing displacement : it made it difficult to build ships very large (such as battleships ) because their hull would have been too weak without placing heavy structural beams across its width ; this problem was solved by building them narrow rather than long. A secondary concern in naval architecture is stability: wide-beamed vessels are inherently unstable, so they need stronger structure or bulwarks for ballasting purposes; however, these structures can interfere with broadsides and reduce available space on board the ship. Finally there were concerns about weight distribution within a warship when all of her guns faced one way .The concept has continued into modern times , although most ships today mount weapons more evenly distributed around their decks (though still not always symmetrically). Broadside armament became especially important to light forces such as destroyers during World War II due to the increased speed at which battleships could now engage each other without having time enough between shots for manoeuvre or avoidance by smaller vessels that would be outmatched in gun duels with any given broadsider but might have an advantage if they engaged together.

> Ericsson (of whom more below) as early as June, although this design never reached production. The British HMS Warrior followed suit shortly afterward and other navies rapidly adopted battleships equipped with them; ironclads such that did so were known informally at one time or another variously "turrett ships", "iron-plated frigates" or simply battle ships—the latter term becoming standard since World War I .  Ironically for its pioneering role it was not until later designs which incorporate advanced steel construction into their hulls , however – including those of Britain's Dreadnought class in the late First World Wa r era —that turrets would become commonplace among warships, even though by then they had been largely supplanted on other types.### Armament and ammunition: Broadside versus Centre Battery Ships (1860–75)  @@@@ 12px ========= '''Broadside''' type battleships were designed to be armed with a main battery consisting entirely or mostly off guns located at deck level .

The first underwater explosive devices known as ' mines' date back from ancient times when Greeks used a simple wooden box filled up with iron spikes or nails . It is however only since early XIX century that these weapons became more effective and in 1865 the French engineer Henri-Louis Breguet created one of his many inventions: an electric mine whose battery powered electrical detonator was activated by pressure applied on it. In order for this new technology not be exploited solely against merchant ships but also warships like battleships , submarines were needed so they could remain undetected beneath surface waves until close enough before releasing their deadliest weapon underwater explosives (torpedoes).### Torpedos after World War I - present day developments since mid XX century [9] @-@ 2014/05/31 凌晨6点３１分[日期：MMYY][纪元：北京时间(UTC+8)]｜来源:《海军》编辑部、国防科技信息网　发布人:吴平原

The early armorers' knowledge was so limited that they used plate as thick as possible; this made their vessels heavy (and slow) because all weight below waterline sank them further into seawater while increasing draft. Ironclads were also subject to rot damage on deck plates exposed by gunports or other openings through the hull .In an effort both for economy of material and strength , designers soon experimenting with different types of iron construction: riveted, screw-built ("screwed"), wrought-iron framed over a wooden skeleton (steel framing first appeared in Russia), steel frames clad with sheet armor formed from rolled plate metal ; later it was found that ships made up entirely out of cast iron sections had great advantages as they could be built much faster than those constructed using steam hammer technology. They were lighter because their hollowness meant no need to provide support beneath them; however this weakened protection against impact damage which became an important factor during World War I .= ======== Hull types : iron and wood - the early years = =========

> with slow production rates (and cost) associated with steel construction. Even though it would have been possible, there were no attempts at all until after World War I to build large warships from steel plate ; this is because large quantities had not yet become available when Britain required them.The widespread adoption by navies around Europe also brought forth a need for standardized designs that could allow shipyards across national borders produce ships quickly using mass-production techniques . The British Royal Navy's first two ironclad battleships HMS Black Prince &@ &@ HMS Duke of Wellington represented the start of an era where naval architecture was rapidly becoming more advanced and complex , with increased firepower  higher speeds (both under sail or steam) and new types such as armored cruisers, protected cruiser/destroyer hybrids known as torpedo boats destroyers etc.### Protected Cruise&rrsquo;s&rsquos early years: 1875–90[edit]

> t.The Dreadnought, launched on October 24th., had an armament like this : two turrets each with four sixteen -inch guns ; one between them carrying eight seven -inches; another amidships mounted three twelve inches . And there were no less than twenty smaller calibre rifles or machine guns for anti torpedo work ! The total weight carried by her displacement was nearly thir teen hundred tons , which included over nine thousand tons o f coal , but the ship herself weighed only five thou sand odd pounds as compared to a battalion of infantry wh ich is about eleven thousan d and therefore she could be moved much more easily.The Dreadnought represented, in effect, an entirely new type of warship that has been copied ever since all nations have possessed iron ships ; though it should b e noted t hat this form had already appeared before any nation had really begun building steamships . This means that if some one were asked what year was chosen for marking the beginning o f modern naval architecture he would not necessarily answer 1876 (the date at which Britain first put her fleet on paper with engines instead or sail ) nor yet 1904 when the British King Edward VII class battleships began to be built but rather about eighteen years earlier.The reason why it is better in practice, however , to choose these latter dates as a starting point i s because although every country has produced large ships of iron and steel since then they have not been very much like Dreadnoughts . The early German warships of this type were too slow ; their French cousins had weak armament; some o f them could never make enough steam for fighting speed an d others did n ot last long owing t o lack or proper maintenance !

Wooden vessels took this abuse more easily than their metal counterparts ; they also had other advantages: they required less machinery (wood did not need coal ), provided better insulation from cold temperatures or heat exposure @-@ range conditions, cost far fewer lives as the crew was smaller compared to ironclads — no explosives , few turrets , light armor .### Iron hulls and steam engines in warships of 1864–70[edit] ]The first successful use by a major navy for its entire fleet came during the American Civil War with USS Monitor. The ship used an innovative design that combined heavy guns on rotating turret arms, protected by railroad iron plates bolted onto wooden framing and powered through screw propulsion—the most advanced technology available at this time period. This new concept revolutionized naval tactics as it allowed ships to remain undamaged while engaging multiple opponents simultaneously; something never before seen since sailing vessels were only capable of attack from one direction due their limitations in speed or maneuverability @-@ range conditions .The British Royal Navy followed suit shortly thereafter when they commissioned HMS Dreadnought (1875), which had been built using similar principles but with even more powerful engines that enabled them reach higher speeds than previous designs could manage without sacrificing armor protection levels too much either way - giving birth literally overnight what would become known colloquially worldwide simply “dreadnaughts” !In contrast however many European navies still preferred wooden hull construction despite being slower & less durable; this was

> [i] . In that same year, Italy’s new Regina Maria Pia displaced over two thousand tons (about twice her designed displacement) on trials at full load because she was built entirely from wrought-iron plate instead of cast or rolled mild steels as were most vessels. However by far more important than these few early experiments is what happened later: France, Britain & Japan all made a major change to their naval construction programs starting about the end of the decade : they began building ships almost exclusively with steel and discontinuing use for any other material in warships.[ii][iii].Steel had been used since ancient times , but it wasn’t until Henry Bessemer invented his process (the “Bessemer Process”) that large scale production became possible . The advantageous properties which have led to its widespread application include strength comparable or superior , depending on treatment ; resistance against corrosion and heat; lightness compared with iron, cast-iron & bronze. But most importantly – even more than cost savings when considering the total lifespan of a ship - was steel's ability to absorb impact without permanent deformation by ductile yielding : unlike mild steels treated only for hardening/tempering where any structural damage leads almost invariably into brittle failure in response.[iv]In 1875, the British Admiralty issued specifications calling for ships that could be built using either wrought or rolled (moulded) armor plating . This decision allowed manufacturers flexibility as regards costs , while at same time ensuring compatibility between vessels constructed under these standards [v]. The first warship made entirely from cast iron was HMS Warrior launched on February of next year - she had

It used mild carbon steels with very low levels if phosphorus which made them weldable without heat treatment ; this was not possible earlier because high temperature gases given off during cutting caused brittleness by carbide formation, like graphite pencils sharpened on their own lead (carbon) cores; a solution found early nineteenth-century French shipbuilder Hippolyte Marin Vaillant using wrought iron as the core and then heating it in steam after being cut .The problem of hardening against impact damage remained until World War I , when Krupp invented ' Hafnerit ' armor that used chromium instead o f phosphorus to keep steel from becoming too soft. This was later replaced with manganese which increased its toughness while keeping strength high enough for protection purposes, resulting in modern steels such us AH36 or DP690C52/BVL18NCD47 . However these materials have poor weldability due their chemical composition so they must be manufactured using other techniques like rolling rather than cutting (as done before 19th century).Armour-piercing shells - These were developed early on but not much use until World War I when German engineers made them more effective by adding a large charge o f explosive behind the armor plate; this was known as ' AP shot '. The problem of getting enough metal onto enemy ships remained though, which meant that many warships had to carry several hundred pounds worth each side just in case one hit took out all others.

> atop her hull ; she had no sides, deckhouse or bridge superstructure. The absence a belt meant that unlike most other contemporary warships with ironclad construction Iron Duke's gunnery would not necessarily suffer any damage during combat as long as enemy shell hit did not penetrate through their turret roofing although this proved irrelevant in practice when they were sunk by torpedoes without suffering gunfire hits either on deck or below waterline and they thus suffered complete destruction .The lack of an upper casemate also made them more vulnerable than others ships which still retained some protection above the armor; however , it was pointed out later after HMS Warrior had been lost to fire from shore batteries at Copenhagen that her design exposed too much hull area compared with other ironclads. The Admiralty would take these criticisms into account for future designs such as those built under the 1863 Iron-Clad Frigates programme (see following section). Although their main guns were in a barbette mounting rather like early steam warships, they did have turreted secondary broadside weapons .The first British ship of this type was Inflexible which entered service three years before USS Monitor and is sometimes regarded as an American copy but she differed greatly enough from her predecessor to be considered independently designed although both ships were influenced by European developments; USS monitor had more than doubled the armour thicknesses compared with HMS Warrior , while retaining very similar hull proportions. The subsequent development towards 'all-armoured' designs represented another major advance over previous ironclad types such that the armored belt became a key component in their design, giving rise also during 1870s to debates about its location on warships

In Britain there was similar enthusiasm for a war of liberation against an unjust despot : The Times printed maps showing Alexandria at night to illustrate just what might be achieved by sea-power ; it also reproduced illustrations from London illustrated papers depicting Egyptian women beggars and the poor . A week later , however , its editorialist noted that 'after all is said ...

> effective, though it did succeed against Austria during her brief involvement.The German Empire had only one active battleship when World War I began (the Kaiser Friedrich III ), but this ship soon proved itself to be very effective at putting fear into Allied fleets. The Imperial Navy's most important strength lay not so much on individual ships as on their organization: a large number and variety fleet units were available for use across many frontiers; these included battlecruisers , cruiser squadrons , torpedo boats . A wide range of coastal defense vessels served the navy by protecting ports from enemy attacks while preventing merchant shipping losses through submarine warfare or blockade running operations against Germany during WWI .The Japanese Empire was able to build up an impressive naval force that rivaled any other nation in Asia before World War I began, but after Japan entered into hostilities with Russia over Korea (1904–5) it quickly became clear just how far behind they really stood. The Russian Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur proved itself a formidable foe for its smaller and outnumbered opponents; however , when British support arrived later on this same fleet would eventually be defeated by superior numbers alone due largely because of poor logistics planning which resulted from lacking sufficient manpower or resources needed elsewhere throughout the war effort .The Royal Navy was able to maintain its position as one of world's most powerful navies during both wars thanks in part through close cooperation between Britain’s colonial possessions such as Canada, Australia & New Zealand who provided additional men along with their own ships/weapons systems that helped keep pace against Germany until 1945!

This changed with Korea ; although President Eisenhower had envisioned a Navy based primarily around aircraft carriers he nevertheless began construction of supercarriers designed specifically for carrier battle group warfare rather than fleet actions alone , and in the 1960s they were put to use against Libya’ s air force after it shot down two American planes over international waters. The US navy also used its superiority at sea when confronting communist North Vietnamese forces on land; by deploying naval gunfire support ships offshore, combined arms formations could be created which led directly into urban combat situations .The end result was that while America still relied heavily upon submarines during World War II (and beyond), she quickly adapted new technologies such as aircraft carriers with nuclear propulsion systems soon afterwards . This allowed for greater mobility both above and below the surface , enabling increased range operations without being limited solely to coastal defense missions like those employed earlier periods of history 20th Century Amphibious Assault Force : A New Model For Naval Operations?

Some historians argue for World War I and/or its immediate aftermath ; others consider it in terms of other technological advances : oil engines or submarines could have been considered more significant than steel . However , one can identify two distinct phases within which design changed significantly. The first was roughly around naval armament during the American Civil War with their use by both sides - although not officially recognised until well into the 20th century . They were also used to a limited extent elsewhere before then (for example, see French ironclads at sea).

He published four books between January-December, including “The Dry Salvages” which is considered one o f t he most important poems written by Eliott or any poet for that matter!

It begins by depicting a snowy landscape at dawn before describing how "the sunlight/Which must have known itself in older lands" now shines over this particular location:  5-6 In his notes Eliot describes little giddings as the smallest , most remote place that he had visited . He makes no reference to any Christian associations but rather uses it solely for its topographical association:428 	As such Little Gidding is considered one of four poems about history and time which deal primarily with recollection (as opposed to historical narrative) ; they are preceded by East Coker, followed by The Dry Salvages. Like other works discussed herein these poetic sequences are not intended or treated thematically in sequence nor do their references necessarily coincide chronologically; however each poem does share a common thread: all concern the process of remembering/recollective memory . For example , Eliot's reference at line -15 "the last cataract" echoes his earlier descriptions found within Sweeney Agonistes where he describes himself as "a ruined tower on which bats have built".In Little Giddings this imagery is combined with another theme concerning fire : according to Kenneth Burke (quoted by Levenson) Fire is here used metaphorically and symbolizes purification from sin or corruption. The first stanza establishes an emotional tone through images evoking fear: darkness, snowfall; while also conveying hopefulness in the form of a sunrise . It has been suggested that Eliot's choice for these words may reflect his own

The last two stanzas discuss artwork created during war times to be shown at court: some portraying great victories while others showcase a more personal story told through an image on canvas or stone carving; this was especially popular when depicting religious scenes for churches throughout Europe .The first section is called “Dante’s Inferno” and describes the journey of Dante Alighieri into Hell, where he encounters many figures from his past. These include Virgil (the Roman poet), Ulysses who had been shipwrecked in Italy after leaving Troy behind him as well as Minos - King Of Crete & Judge At The Underworld's Gateway To Eternity !  This poem ends with Canto XXIV which talks about how much better things would be if only people could learn to live together instead fighting one another over trivial matters like money or power .The second section is called “Purgatorio.” It starts off by describing Purgatory itself before moving onto tell us all kinds of interesting facts: for example there are three levels where souls spend time depending on their sins! After this comes an explanation that explains what happens once someone gets out alive after being punished in Hell; they will go through a process known as purification - meaning cleansing oneself from the evil deeds done during life. Finally, we hear some more details about how long it takes until those who have been redeemed can finally enter heaven again :)  The third and final part focuses mainly upon Dante’s journey towards Paradise while he is still trying to figure things out along his way

When Little Gidding first appeared, the poem was received with mixed reviews by critics; some praised what they perceived as a return towards Eliot's earlier work while others condemned him for departures in form or content that had been absent before from his writing during this period (which included Four Quartets). It has since become one of most famous pieces written throughout modern literature - often cited alongside The Waste Land when discussions about great poetry arise today  ; although there are those who feel it does not stand up to its predecessor due largely because readers find themselves unable fully understand allusions made within text which may require greater knowledge than many possess .

> You have known me for seven years, / In that time I've changed my mind about everything" (ll.14–5) suggests he is not referring specifically to any one person but rather speaking from himself and others who had been dead all along : thus he says at once both 'you know him' and also '"I am become death'. Death means nothingness ; this meaning seems literal when Eliot describes his name change from Prufrock back into a ghost-like figure with no identity: "'The evening spread its velvet lap ,/ And hugged the fire.' He gave up being human in order to be something else . The end of "The Hollow Men", where it looks as if there are two voices, has an ambiguity similar that which characterizes Ezra pound's Cantos. In 1943, Paul Valéry wrote about this work :"...[this poem] is both profane and sacred; you must have read TS Elliott 's new poems ; they will make your head spin ... I haven't seen anything like them for a long time."## Background on Eliot’ s career before Four Quartets (published posthumously) - “Growth” in the Poet’ s Life of Mind – What kind of man was he?

> Dante’s own experience as a poet. He was born during an epidemic, so he believed his life had been spared for some divine purpose (he saw himself both as “the pilgrim” and also sometimes referred by others with such appellations). As well-known scholars have noted repeatedly over many decades,[5] this belief made him feel that if God wanted something from him it would be unacceptable not to provide what he asked.[6][7]. In addition , because poetry is often seen in the context of suffering or painful emotions like despair when one fails at writing;[8], we can understand why Yeats might use swimming through fire imagery here too — perhaps suggesting how difficult things are going right now for writers who want success but aren’t getting any?

> 51 The subject matter does not contain a single Christian image or concept (with one exception) but rather speaks through an Eastern religious language which was mostly unknown at this time to Western readers; it therefore requires some explanation as well as interpretation, though perhaps even then few could grasp its full meaning without prior knowledge about Buddhism itself:...the forms are temporary, but they last long enough for us to learn from them. It is like waking up outdoors after sleeping all night under stars you knew by heart when you were young—to find that everything has changed and there's no longer anything familiar in the sky . 52 The final stanza of Little Gidding illustrates how Eliot uses imagery drawn not only from his own personal experience (with a "moment" which refers back to his childhood) but also metaphysical concepts such as time-space continuum; this ties it with an Eastern tradition:In my beginning , I am endless ; And, in mine ending I have begun. 53The poem ends on what seems like ambiguous words suggesting some kind of closure or fulfilment : “I shall remember you”—words that are both human and impersonal at the same time . They may refer either directly to memory itself ("I will always keep your name alive") or more generally they could mean any form of remembrance from a religious point view (“you were baptized into Christ by water / You died before you had finished dying" ). In terms o f Christianity this might indicate one's entry through death unto eternal life as well as "the memorial service for departed souls , which is held in their honour after burial." 54The poem ends with two words: “Farewell”. This has been interpreted variously, but perhaps it refers back again not only to the beginning and

They clamoured incessantly for my thoughts, so loudly did their voices ring. The concept of the struggle between species , which was already inherent in these two philosophers [Nietzsche &amp; Darwin] only awaited its completion at that time to become a world outlook." He also refers several times throughout this speech to National Socialism being merely an extension or fulfilment of earlier theories such as those by Hegel .Secondly Hitler claims it is not true he has murdered millions but rather it should be regarded instead simply " a tragic necessity" arising from what they have done : ". I can admit and recognize everything, even if there were exaggerations. But one thing must remain intact: the fact remains , whether you like i t or no lt does n't matter ...

Some Jewish groups protested that audiences would be sympathetic to Hitler, in part due to McHale-Jones' portrayal which was described at the time variously as:* unflinching   * daring    * compassionatebut also arrogant/arbitrary / manipulative .  The controversy increased when a production of this same adaptation opened on Broadway with Ian McKellen playing Adolf and John Wood starring alongside him - this time winning four Tonys (including "Best Actor" ) , though it still failed after less than half its projected run. After an initial negative response from Jewish groups who were concerned about audience sympathy for Hitler, some critics took note that McHale-Jones' portrayal was sympathetic; others found his performance lackluster while many thought he had done little more then to impersonate the man through accent alone without fully exploring how such things as racism or homophobia might have affected someone like himself growing up under Nazi rule .* The most recent Broadway revival starred John Malkovich and directed by George Cukor in a production which received mixed reviews but has since been seen on HBO.The book is also noted because it marked an early collaboration between author Ken Kesey (who wrote " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ") , playwright Terrence McNally (" Master Class ", among others) ; their friendship would last until his death from cancer at age sixty

They were probably early relatives of modern frogs and salamanders , but they may have been more closely related with mammals than reptiles . The name comes from the ancient Greeks who considered them to be "worm like" because their bodies appeared coiled or folded over on themselves when viewed in profile - which is how many paleontologists found these fossils before studying dissections ( where it would become clear that what seemed wound-like were simply soft body parts ).The Temnospondyli lived between approximately about two hundred million years ago until around fifty thousand years ago, during all major periods except for one small hiatus spanning part of Carboniferous and Triassic times. They had simple eyes with no corneas , but did have an optically powered lens system behind them . Their vertebrae also lack a joint called the intercentrum which connects adjacent centra in most amphibians - instead they have bony plates on either side attached directly to their skull or trunk ( though some groups may not actually be related at all ).The Temnospondyli are considered paraphyletic because it includes both extinct lineages like Eryops as well modern living ones such Leptodactylidae ("frog-like" frogs), and Nectridean salamanders.

The origin of tetrapods is a subject for debate; some researchers believe that they evolved from fish within an aquatic environment ; other scientists support the theory that these amphibians began their existence on land, with some species returning to water later in life.A few living organisms are considered close relatives (including salamandrids such as mudpuppies and newts ), or at least superficially similar enough to be mistaken by non-experts: modern members include frogs , caecilians / gymnophiones ("blindworms"), and tuataras . The earliest tetrapods were small — even smaller than a frog today; however, many groups evolved into large terrestrial predators of enormous size over the course of 150 million years that could rival land mammals like horses, alligator lizards upwards in length.The name "tetrapod" is derived from Ancient Greek  τέσσαρες (téssares) 'four' +  πούς (póus), meaning literally four-footed , referring to their four limbs or feet: two legs

They had an extremely diverse range including gliding forms like pterodactyls as well as flying ones such a tupandactyly. Ptero means "wing" while saur comes form Greek sauros meaning lizard and thus they are reptiles with wings . The name was coined by the German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in honor of Sir Richard Owen who first described them back then during his research on fossil birds which he thought might have been related somehow since these animals were both bipedal creatures that lived before dinosaurs existed yet another example showing how little we really know about evolutionary history sometimes haha!Pteranodon is an extinct genus of pterodactylid from late Maastrichtian age North America. It had a long snout, large eyes set far apart atop its head; wing membranes extended past its elongated hind limbs with toes arranged like fingers instead being fused together into one claw . Ptero was also known for having thickened jaws filled full teeth made up mostly out of blunt conical structures resembling those found in modern birds rather than sharp hooked ones seen on other members within this group such as Dimorphodon or Rhamphorhynchus which were both smaller more agile predators capable catching prey quickly before it could escape them by flying away from danger zone!Pterosaurs are an extinct type of vertebrate that

These organisms resemble corals in having tentacles arranged around an opening surrounded by one or more mouths; they differ from true coral animals because phycology have no calcareous skeletons but only soft tissues filled with air. They often live attached to rocks on which they may form large colonies composed entirely individual polyps all sharing the same water supply system, as well as many other characteristics similar those found among marine algae and mosses . Some of these creatures even produce eggs that are fertilized internally rather than externally through external gametes!Phylum Brachiopoda includes about 20 living genera in two orders: Order Pteraspidiformes (Cope) has some very primitive forms such <unk> ; while Orders Rhynchonelliforms & Inarticulata have more advanced representatives e.g., Bryozoa , Lingulida etc.; there is also a third group called Phyllodoceratidae which contains only one genus now extinct but still found as fossils throughout world’s oceans today .

This last genus is notable because it has been found preserved inside of an amber specimen along with several insects.The largest forms were aquatic giants such as Dolichopareias ; some reached lengths approaching two meters (6 ft). Other species had more terrestrial lifestyles that may have involved occasional forays into shallow water, but these animals never lived on land exclusively; most remained fully aquatic throughout their lives . Such adaptations allowed them to thrive during this time period when many other groups suffered from changes in climate and environment brought about by the end-Carboniferous extinction event at around Mya , which killed off much life worldwide including all of today's amphibians except frogs.The group survived through until early Permian times - although it did undergo a severe decline beginning near its peak as competition increased among different lineages within <unk>.

There are many other ways these animals obtain nourishment from their environment but let me tell you about just one kind called "flying" which involves using wingspan combined w/paddling action caused by swimming movements created when feet touch water surface below them causing vibrations throughout entire body structure allowing individual organisms to glide across any type of liquid substance including lakes rivers oceans etc..

One fossil specimen contains several complete egg masses , suggesting this area may be important for future studies on these <unk> animals . The study also shows that aquatic plants were abundant during Early permian times which is significant because many modern frogs require wetlands to breed successfully making them highly susceptible to habitat destruction caused by humans activities such as draining swamps or polluting rivers with chemicals from factories nearby.The discovery has implications beyond just understanding early tetrapod evolution; it could help us better understand how amphibians survived the great extinction event 250 million years ago when most of life was wiped out due in part because there wasn't enough oxygen available for photosynthesis . In addition , knowing more about these creatures may lead researchers closer towards finding cures <unk> diseases like skin cancer which affect many people worldwide today - especially those living near bodies water where sun exposure is high .

This suggests strong parental care among the ancestors of modern amphibians: many females deposit their clutches close together, often on rocks near water sources where predators cannot easily reach them (such as shallow pools) but also sometimes far away from any source such that they must have been able to carry off or move some portion around with them when moving between these two locations during incubation periods lasting several weeks before hatchlings emerge .The eggs are laid by both males and females; however only one species has ever been found in association with an adult specimen indicating possible brooding behavior similar enough for it not being considered unusual among temnospondyls.  Temnospongyli were amphibians which lived throughout much of the Mesozoic Era, although their fossil record is limited compared other groups like lepidosaurs (snakes lizards) because they lack hard skeletal elements such as bones that could be preserved over time through sedimentary processes or subsequent erosion events. They had large bodies typically ranging between two meters long but some may have reached lengths up to four times longer than this maximum value

The technique has also been shown to provide useful information about the intensity of weaker systems such as typhoons, but it does not work well in situations where a system's surface circulation becomes disorganized due either from land interaction or decay.The first step involves assigning one image out every five minutes starting at least two hours before any satellite imagery become available after formation time TFAT = [3 - (T + C) / A] , where T and C are the Dvorak-adjusted tropical cyclone age (in days since formation ) and convective period respectively for that particular storm .

After a number or other improvements were introduced into various forms over time (such as improved processing techniques), SAB formally adopted its current version for use during typhoon forecasts issued between May - October each year in February ,2015## Forecasting methodology = ="="= "Forecaster's note" ============In addition to convective characteristics such as brightness temperature values of individual cloud features that may be indicative of storm strengthening/weakning and intensity, the Dvorak technique also uses information on location within an analysis domain wherein the maximum value is considered when determining a central pressure estimate. This is important because some tropical cyclones form over water or near islands with relatively low surface pressures which can affect forecast errors at landfall . A table below outlines how each variable contributes towards SAB’S final estimated wind speed for any given typhoon (in knots):15 - Convection in general: The more convective activity present around a cyclone ,the higher its rating will be = "Table" ===========================20-49 Brightness Temperature : bright, warm cloud tops indicate the presence of high thunderstorms within an area and are therefore indicative strengthening. Cold clouds on top would imply weakenning due to cooling air aloft .(Note that this is not necessarily true when there's just one single cold core or if it is small)    86 – Location (within an analysis domain): As mentioned earlier some typhoon form over water which has lower surface pressures than land areas , so any storm forming in such a region may have its central pressure estimated too low

These automatic methods work well under ideal conditions where satellite data is available at all times; however they fail when clouds or land masks block views from satellites as seen during Hurricane Ivan (1995). The most common method used by meteorologists today uses two different types: 2D analysis based off of infrared imagery and objectively derived wind patterns through Dvorak Technique . This technique involves banded areas which correspond with specific strength levels in tropical cyclones that are then mapped out over time using observations made every six hours along its track path until it dissipates completely - giving us our final estimate for intensity/location within about three days after forming!

He is also known for his incredible control although there are times where I wonder if this is more luck than anything else since he does walk far too many batters over long periods of time but when the walks do come they tend to be wild pitches that either get past him or go up & away from hitters so you just never know what will happen on any given day . Kershaw was drafted in 1st round by LAD (30th overall) out of High School back during June / July ’06 before signing a professional contract later that year at age seventeen years old two months after turning eighteen which meant it took place prior t o his high school graduation date hence why there is no hanging around as he made his debut with them right then and began dominating opposing batters almost immediately !Kershaw’s first full season came between April/May-June – August when he went 7–2 w I T A M P H O R E S .

He also has improved deception with arm angles around high school level pitching coaches have said Kershaw's biggest strength comes from not being predictable, in other words , his release point will always vary between six inches below shoulder height to just above waistline or even higher and this makes batters uncomfortble at any given moment because they cannot figure out where he might throw next

That day during batting practice , you saw how many pitches fell for strikes ; everything felt great, like my command is locked down ... but then if something happens in that outing where your velocity dips or there's just one hiccup with location on some throws, at least now those feelings are familiar to me '' (Kershaw) said after his no-hit performance against Arizona.

Each study has been referred to as having no humanity; they are depicted without any emotional content whatsoeverBacon's artistic career spanned more than four decades , during which he experimented with a wide range of styles . He began his painting career working within the figurative tradition and soon became known for paintings that incorporated raw imagery , including screaming popes against flat backgrounds, and mutilations such as sewn-up mouth shapes in triptychs . His work is characterised by bold brushstrokes, vivid colour contrast (often juxtaposing pastel tones next to deep shadows), deformity or distortion of human forms. Bacon was also an admirer from afar (but not much more) until 1970 when he made a trip with Peter Beard on safari through AfricaAfrica where they encountered the most feared lions; after this experience his approach changed for good and moved away entirely from figurative painting towards pure abstraction: “I’ve always been interested in the non-human animal.” In addition to paintings , sculpture has played a significant role throughout Frank's career . He began creating small stone heads around age thirty, which became larger works over time ; by forty five years old these had grown into enormous human forms cast out of bronze or marble that could fill entire rooms at times—a marked departure from previous styles he employed during earlier periods when smaller pieces were

The figures are isolated against solid colors such that it becomes difficult to distinguish whether these color fields represent walls and floors .Aside from their highly stylized abstraction , they also demonstrate Bacon's penchant for symbolism in his early work : the heads have been compared with human skull s, while some critics see them as representations (of themselves) by various members within society ; others regard them instead merely abstracted forms devoid any particular significance other than what we bring into viewing process ourselves.

> pheric lightness.The focus on anatomy seems entirely natural given his interest, but also because this has been such an important subject matter since ancient times -even sculpture was known to have depended upon accurate knowledge regarding the nature of muscle tissue at least from 5th century BC Greece (when Hippocrates established the correlation between mind/body ). It' s perhaps unsurprising that he had studied drawing while still young; it is well-documented how many great artists in history were self taught . His choice to be trained formally however would prove crucial for its effects both aesthetic and professional , as we shall see later.He moved on quickly after completing his Diploma course, first working under Professor Ossip Zadkine who would become one of Britain’s most celebrated sculptors until he died aged only fifty seven years old -he also worked alongside Henry Moore during this period at The Borough Polytechnic Institute ( now London South Bank University ) where they shared teaching duties with other notable figures such as Lynn Chadwick 20th century British artist known mainly through her abstract welded steel works . They became lifelong friends despite their differences; while both men were interested in the human form , Moore' s work tended towards abstraction whereas Zdankie was more concerned with realism.He went on to have several solo exhibitions throughout his career including 'Early Sculpture & Drawings’ presented by the New Art Centre Gallery, Roche Court near Salisbury between October - December 1965 which displayed many of these early pieces alongside some later ones ; he also had a retrospective at The Royal Academy London from May until September that year where there were fourteen sculptures and nine drawings .

> ​​what it would be. The starting point for this triptych was an image from Picasso' s Guernica (1937) : "I had been looking at [Guernica] with interest because I felt its power but also its coldness, which fascinated me." He began by painting over some other works on paper as if they were studies or sketches to create what became Head II ; then proceeded directly onto two canvases side-by -side . In the absence of any detailed plan , Bacon worked intuitively and freely in order that both images might develop simultaneously into a single entityThe figures are derived entirely from Velázquez 's Portrait of Pope Innocent X (c. 1650). The inspiration for this was suggested by an image found in a book about Spanish art: "I remember looking at it [the portrait] one day when I had been reading something else, some other painting ... But suddenly there was such power coming out." He made only minor changes to his source : he added two hands reaching upward ; moved them higher on their owners' bodies; shortened the fingers , changed the position and length of each thumb . With these alterations Bacon created what is perhaps most recognisable as a recurring feature throughout much of his oeuvre -The choice not just illustrates how deeply rooted Velázquez 's influence upon him has become but also demonstrates that, in spite or because this figure represents an old man rather than someone younger it can be used for various purposes. This applies both figuratively (in terms e g) ) which include aspects like sexuality/desire etc.) & literally: ies such those seen here where he uses images from paintings by other artists to create new works himself , something commonly done among contemporary painters today .

The artist himself describes these paintings, where colour takes precedence over form:"The idea of a tapestry room came out of my interest in weaving and also in carpets; I was interested at that time more than ever before ... [W]e were living on very little money - not much even for food . But you see there are certain things that take priority � like drinking ; so all our savings went into wine. And then the furniture would go from year's end till next Christmas with various people who had moved away or died... It got worse every winter because it became warmer , but one wanted to be warm, too ! So finally when spring arrived again everybody used their own stuff as they found a place (in London) where they could stay."These paintings mark a point in Bacon’s career: an almost total rejection of figurative representation and its replacement by abstracted forms. Influenced by Cézanne - he was particularly interested at this time in his later work such as The Bathers � Bacon adopted the painterly method of loose brushstrokes which enabled him to avoid representational depictions altogether while still retaining some semblance for figuration . He also experimented with different materials , including gesso on wood panels rather than canvas, allowing greater fluidity within each painting itself but limiting their size so that they could be moved around easily when necessary without risk damage from exposure over long periods ; these works were much smaller too; thus many more were possible per year compared those done using oil paint alone or

> ptation towards non-figurative imagery. His move away from figuration, however, had been underway since his second stay with Gorkin during early summer when he painted three figurations against plain background: Figure on Red (18 June) ; Studies in Pink II; Study after Manet I - all were black paintings done directly onto white primed canvas which allowed him more freedom than working upon a ground prepared by earlier layers of color or tone , and less time spent sanding down and repainting an area before the next layer could be applied . This technique became increasingly important to Bacon's work as it progresses towards abstractionThe following year at Dürrenmatt ' s studio, Berlin was painting Black Triptych – a trio of panels depicting three human heads superimposed on top one another. A few months later in August he produced Three Studies for Figures (1948) - wherein two nude male bodies are shown locked together face-to-face within their own rectangles; each is surrounded by its individual field painted black with red highlighted areas around eyes and mouth giving them an expressionist quality reminiscent perhaps most promiently , if not solely then certainly heavily influenced by Picasso's Les Demoiselles d’AvignonBacon continued his studies through the end o f that year . He made four drawings based upon Velázquez ' s Las Meninas which were all but destroyed in a fire at Gorky's studio early March of next ; he did however manage to salvage one panel from this series titled Three Studies for Figures (1948) as well another from later that same month called Study after Manet II: A Young Woman Seated.

What remains are my own sensations—my lips cracking as I speak; sweat dripping down into my mustache ; an earache coming on when I turn up music too loudly ".Even if not entirely correct (I’m still researching this), it does seem that Bacon did want his paintings of lone figures seated at desks/tables with back-lit computer screens – like “Sleep” above -to portray people isolated by their technology: a single person sitting alone before some sort of screen which cuts him off from the outside world and alienates everyone else, thereby turning them all against one another. If he was able to do so successfully in any way then you can see why Google would be attracted to such imagery for its logo; especially when they are constantly trying new things or going through various phases (such as recently becoming more mobile friendly).The problem is that Bacon’s work doesn’t really convey this feeling very well at times because there isn't much depth behind what appears on first glance - unless perhaps if someone knew exactly where those paintings were located within their artistic context! For example: maybe it could have been done better by showing us something about how people interact with each other online instead? Maybe even show them using computers together but still keeping some distance between themselves since we all know everyone hates being around others these days lol.

It was painted at an important stage for both artist & model: Francis had just been diagnosed with acute appendicitis, while George Dyer also suffered from serious health problems (a stomach ulcer). The painting's subject matter may reflect the pair’s physical and mental illnesses.In October/November Bacon wrote to his friend Eric Hall : "I have begun again . I am going on like mad now." He added that he felt much better after being in hospital having surgery earlier that year; this suggests a period of depression , which may explain why Head II is considered by some critics as lacking the painterly forceful quality evident in other works at around 1948–50: for example, Portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne (Tate) or Triptych – Augustus John from 1962(National Gallery). The work was also exhibited alongside fourteen others when Francis Bacon died aged eighty-two years old.## Reception and legacy[3] [edit ]

> At the time, his greatest concern seemed to be not so much with artistic expression but rather with financial success : it may have occurred at this point (in July ) when Bacon left Lucian Freud 's house in Chelsea after an argument about money ; from then until October there are no entries concerning him or any visitors.Bacon apparently used his travel diaries as sketchbooks during these years and they provide valuable information regarding many aspects: besides the head-sketches mentioned above which were clearly done by himself, we also find a series entitled " Bali pictures ", executed on 21 June , several drawings of nudes taken while he was visiting Palermo between May to August . The latter had been painted over with pink paint but underneath could still be seen a sequence that Bacon called "the most wonderful" (see p ). There is evidence for some kind of contact through letters in November when <unk> sent him an invitation from London.On his return to England after three months away during December and January, Bacon spent nearly all the time at home except one day when he went into town - perhaps even more than usual because there were no visitors listed up until then; this might indicate another period where painting was put on hold or something else occupied himself instead such as reading , listening music etc.. The last entry reads: '10/36'. It's unclear what exactly happened here but it could be that these dates correspond with those given by Bridges who says she met Francis 29th March (after her birthday). If so we can assume they had become friends in London before his trip abroad? This would make sense since many people have noted how much their relationship changed over time which is why I think its worth mentioning again .Bacon kept a journal throughout the years of 1954 to about September when he was

His position on two-dimensional space resembles a map projection in which north appears at top , east above west below south; but while most maps do not show people inhabiting their territories — only landmarks such as cities , riversand mountain ranges appear therein — Bacon's painting shows us his isolated figure . The pope is seen from the front and slightly off center with one leg bent backwards underneath him ; he stands still despite being surrounded by activity around himself that seems chaotic yet orderly simultaneously because it has been rendered according to recognizable geometric rules (the curve of each head or arm follows an ellipse rather than any irregular line) - giving this scene both depth perception due its verticality & perspective along z-axis but also flatness since all objects lie at same plane regardless how far away they are located on canvas surface itself<br/>The popes have always represented power , authority, and wealth. Innocent X was a very powerful pope who used his influence over other countries in Europe . He had many enemies so he needed protection from them which is why there were three paintings made by Bacon instead one painting with only two figures like usual for artists during that time period because it would be easier to see where each person stood within their own rank hierarchy if more than just one figure appeared per scene (this meant less work overall). <br/><b></i></li>

At first glance there seems no sense why he should have chosen such unusual angles from his subject' s pose – although notably it is also possible here too that they are actually hands held aloft rather than arms placed downwardly - but again Bacon made a point of stressing how important these details were in terms creating specific effects within the painting itself: "I wanted to make sure I got all those things"In The Head Of An Apostle , he has extended this device even further, by having both right and left arm touch each other repeatedly at different points along their length . This creates several opportunities for contact between parts which may seem disparate (for example when one hand reaches out from behind another) while simultaneously avoids any sense there might be an absence or complete lack here as well. Indeed it is precisely because they are often only partially visible that such moments become so powerful; if we cannot see where exactly these limbs meet then our minds fill in the gaps themselves resulting perhaps with us feeling more intensely than ever before what Bacon intended to convey through his artwork!## Artistic Style of Francis Bacon’s Paintings and Sculptures 1950-2013: A Study into Their Visual Language, Iconography & Cultural Contextualisation within Modernism/Postmodernist Theory – Thesis Draft by Professor Anthony Giddens (University College London)

His father worked for an oil company . Bacon had one brother , Francis Xavier, who died from meningitis two months after their mother ' s death of cancer on January third 1957 ; she left her husband David to bring the boys back to Dublin Ireland with a family friend named Aileen O'Toole (later known as Auntie Fanny) whom they knew well because he was often at dinner parties where "their" servants were also invited along with some other families such as The Cohens or even Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper himself -Bacon lived in London during World War II and was interned for several weeks. He studied art history while working part time jobs, including one teaching English . After being released from prison , Bacon moved into an artist’s studio that had been built by his father; it became the center of his life until 1974 when another family member died there too leaving behind only memories (and perhaps some paintings).

The paintings show some similarities: both use an almost identical colour scheme – grey-blue with pale reds; they each contain just one subject seated before a plain background against which their hair falls forward as though being blown back from them and above which hang curtained windows through whose lacework filigree can be glimpsed .The painting is painted on canvas of Bacon 's own making , in what he called " the mural method ": i e., thinly applied oil paints laid down directly onto unpriming linen, overlaid by thicker layers to build up form and texture. It measures 51 x 62 cm (approx..9 ft). The composition has been compared with that of Velázquez' Portrait o Innocent X but it differs considerably: whereas there are three figures visible against a plain background behind them here only one figure sits before an empty space; moreover their faces do not look out at us as if they were aware we might be watching – instead Bacon focuses our attention on the head alone .The painting is believed to have had its first public exhibition in London at Marlborough Fine Art, New Bond Street , between March–April @-@ and again from June - July 1956.

> ed Rembrandt as an artist, he never produced work that resembled his portraiture or figure painting. Instead, like many other artists before them including Manet (whose paintings influenced both artists), they were inspired by Rembrandts' self-portraits rather than their portrayals others; this was because they felt these works revealed more about themselves and offered opportunities to experiment with compositional ideas. Both men had similar interests in exploring how people interact within confined spaces such as rooms without any external distraction from outside forces – something which could only be achieved through direct observation instead of relying on imagination alone .### Formal analysis 2: Oil mediums used for "Pope Innocent X" painting compared against Velázquez ' work, "Portrait Of Pope Innocent X".

He also utilises multiple shades of grey throughout which further enhances this idea .In terms style there are many differences too; both artists employ similar techniques such as perspective distortion but where they differ is through how much detail each artist chooses show versus hide from viewers. In particular, it seems clear at first glance that although some areas seem almost overdone with brushstrokes , others appear underworked leaving us wondering if anything was really painted here after all! This type contrast plays into another important aspect : composition - specifically its use within contextualising space around subject matter being depicted (which becomes even more obvious when comparing these two works side by side

> lipian cipher" (a reference to French writer Raymond Queneau's literary style, which often uses symbols)  that he once seemed destined for.Another influence on Bacon was Samuel Beckett 's play Happy Days ; this has been suggested as one reason why so many characters are seen seated with their heads down and back turned away from us – they look defeated by life rather than at peace or content; as if waiting for something terrible to happen. In fact it is thought that much more literature influenced his work , including Dostoyevsky . He also considered himself a philosopher : " I am not interested in painting objects," he said (in 1965), "[I] want to paint the human condition". The notion of seeing mankind reduced, perhaps even crushed beneath what might be interpreted literally-as-symbols was later taken up by Francis Alÿsz [ fr ] who described Bacon's art as being based on an almost cruel logic and in the process defined him at once against both Modernism – which had claimed that all forms were valid provided they worked for their creator – and Surrealism , where anything is possible.The dominant colours used are black or brown; these may have been chosen because a dark background makes facial features stand out more . This also gives his works greater depth: one reviewer has said " He draw[ed] you into them, with dramatic chiaroscuro". Some of this effect was achieved through what he called 'theatrical tricks', including using artificial lighting (sometimes two different coloured bulbs), as well as painting on unprimed canvas so the paint would adhere better to it than if primers had first been applied  : in both cases Bacon's aim appears to be that viewers should not just see but feel and experience an image. His use of contrast is a key

> . Many artists adopted similar approaches, including Duchamp's Nude Descending Staircase (1912), which resembles an abstract poem written on paper or canvas rather than being painted as such; it emphasizes that any visual work must be interpreted by viewers with their own eyes and minds before they can grasp what the artist was trying for – thus making interpretation itself part of the creative processImaginists believed poetry should aim at clarity and directness over complexity & obscurity ; they rejected abstraction . They also advocated a return to everyday life : realistic detail in poems about common subjects , instead of romanticised images from history books etc. Imagist writing often used free verse without rhyme schemes because this form allows more flexibility when describing something like nature or an object's appearance (or both). The word "imagism" comes not only from its focus on imagery but also due to how these authors would imagine themselves living within their work: experiencing firsthand what happens around them rather than relying solely upon observation aloneThe most famous example perhaps being Ezra Pound who wrote many pieces during his time spent abroad which included travelogues & other works that describe scenes he saw while away; such poems were highly influenced by Asian culture . For instance, one line reads “I wandered lonely as a cloud” (from William Wordsworth’s poem) shows us exactly where this poet was when writing about clouds above London – an image brought back from China! It'll leave you wondering if it really happened or not because we don't know whether the writer actually witnessed what they say took place before him/her. This type of imagery became popular among later generations after its introduction in 1920–35The movement also introduced new forms like prose poetry , which is

In January he called for "a complete revolution" to take place within English letters; in February Pound declared himself a poet (his first published poem appeared on April Fool ' s Day ), but by May he was already writing about Imagism .<unk> His idea came from contact with French Symbolists such as Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Valery , whom the young American had met at James Joyce 's house near Trieste. The two poets shared many interests, including their disdain of Victorian poetry which they saw as sentimental or decorative .  Their preference was instead for ''objective'' verse that relied upon vivid imagery to convey its meanings without explicit explanation in prose; this tendency would become known later on under a number of names - Pound called it "direct treatment" ; Hulme spoke about conveying ideas through visual analogy (he wrote: "[A] poem is like an object seen from different points").<unk> Imagism , however, can be traced back further than the Symbolists. The poets who were influenced by French symbolist writing and preoccupied with concrete detail include J. Fletcher Vandyke .  Influences also included Japanese haiku poetry , which emphasizes sharp imagery over narrative content or intellectual meaning . <unk> Although Ezra's idea was to eliminate all extraneous words in a line of verse - he said "The core of every image should contain its full force"- Hulme believed that ''objective'' style could accommodate more abstract

However, while some critics have argued about whether or not Pounds' experiments constituted an innovative departure into new territory when compared with similar work by others during same period—such claims are disputed because several poets had already been experimenting extensively since around mid-18th century. For example , W B Yeats later acknowledged how strongly influenced his own early poetry was by Hartmanns "French sonnet" form (a type of poem he himself called 'Donnean') even though it wasn’t until much latter that anyone coined term ‘Yeatsiansonnet.’

This type also incorporates musical elements such that one has no choice other than reading aloud while listening closely since most readers find them hard to understand due their complexities (Morrison). This style can easily confuse the reader because of overlapping images or sounds like birds chirping among others as well multiple words for single objects. The author uses these techniques so he could portray different meanings through a simple word without losing any essence from it hence making his writing more interesting .Joyce's poetry is characterized by its free-flowing nature, where each line flows into another with little pause between stanzas and sentences; this creates an uninterrupted flow that carries you along until reaching end conclusion after which there will be no need to read again unless one wants additional information about something mentioned earlier during reading process (Morrison). This feature makes readers feel relaxed while they are going down memory lane since all thoughts come naturally instead being forced upon them like most poems do today. It also helps in avoidance of repetition because every word has meaning behind it unlike other forms...Joycean Poetry . (2018, Nov 30). Retrieved from https://phdessay.com/joycian-poetry/

He also criticized Hulme's attitude toward poetry as based too much upon formal considerations, whereas for him more emphasis should be placed upon content or message; this led ultimately into his denunciation later that same decade (1920)of Eliot’s idea to construct a “metaphysical” poem about London Bridge . In contrast with these arguments , Pound took up positions defending both literary form against criticism like Poe and Rilke who believed it could only reflect the emotions of mankind at any given time  in history but he was equally opposed to what Flint described "as an obsession on individual sensibility" which resulted from such influences as D. H Lawrence, whose work had been brought before him by Richard AldingtonThe immediate effect upon British poetry was not great: one notable exception is T.

This was because the former were grounded in formal experiment , whereas for Ezra Pound and F . T .

> that we produced were better than any written since, because they had been wrung out by a pressure from within which is impossible for anyone who has not gone through it." Pound' s mastery over language and syntax was widely imitated during this period. He set an example to many writers ; one that would have deep consequences on contemporary literature well into our own time. In some ways he can be considered as inventor or at least main promoter (even if perhaps unwittingly) of what came later called free verse . His influence however extended beyond poetry: Ezra Pound also influenced visual artists , including such figures in the Italian Futurism movement like Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà   Marcello Mascherini    Giacomo Balla     Gino Severini    Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and especially Amedeo Modigliani whose work was characterized by an "abstract expressionist" style that many critics attributed to his friendship with a young poet named Jean Cocteau. He wrote about him : "...the mask is not enough for me; I want a man's face - or else it will be unmasked." Modern painters were drawn from Pound’s circle of friends including Wyndham Lewis , Henri Gaudier-Brzeska ( who died in 1915 fighting at the Somme )   David Jones .His preoccupation, as he expressed in Canto II ("Today") and elsewhere, with classical Chinese poetry would have influence on Ezra Pound' s disciples such as Louis Zukofsky ' whose work was heavily influenced by his reading The Classic Anthology: An Introduction to Classical Literature for Students.

" There was no question of any direct contact between surrealisme as it developed after its foundation, or even after the appearance (in 1924) of La Révolution surréaliste" wrote Jean-Pierre Richardson ; but "I have no doubt that some poems published at this time could be seen to anticipate certain aspects which were characteristic not onlyof Bretonian Surrealism."### Publication history: selected works in English translation from periodical publication c. 1908–c. 2035[edit] ]In their book The Imagist Poetry Anthology , editors Stephen Burt and Michael Scharf state : 'Much imagistic poetry was first circulated by small magazines, both literary journals like the Egoist (founded 1914) or Others . . ;' and "A number of poems did appear as broadsides during this time [around World War I], but for our purposes we have chosen to include only those that were published initially between April/Mayof Ezra Pound in London; these are listed below.

> ative source for Charles Olson' s projective verse [see also LANGUAGE POETRY ] ______ *****structuralism : in poetry - see STRYKER MICHAEL A. STRUC-TURALISM IN THEORY AND PRACTICEstructure (1) : in poetry In 20th century American and British literary theory, structure is used as an alternative term for "form," or more precisely narratology/plot: the organization by which events are connected to one another within poems . The focus on structuring the poem often derives from a Marxist view of literature , though it may be found elsewhere ; however that might have been derived from Marx's materialistic analysis [see FORMS ]structure in formalism : formalists defined all aspects of writing using structures based upon those they believed were implicit rather than explicit. They viewed their approach not so much as scientific but social-scientific; hence , although there was no universal agreement among them about what constituted proper structure, they did agree with each other enough for such generalizations to make sense and thus become acceptable criteria by which literary works could be evaluated . This is one reason why the term "formal" has come into common usage: because critics believe it gives an objective viewpoint on how a poem or story should go together - that it can reveal something meaningful beyond just its wordsstructure in New Criticism : the basic unit of formal analysis (i e poetry' s elements ) are referred to collectively rather than individually as structures. For example , line length might count toward structural formulation along side rhyme scheme; similarly syllabics would determine meter even though there may also exist other devices such as alliteration and consonance which could be considered part of metrical structure .

The operation occurred on two fronts: from Mogadishu's airport via a C–5 Galaxy cargo plane that landed at Dulles International Airport in Virginia ; and another group travelled to Nairobi, Kenya before flying back home aboard an American Airlines jetliner with 273 passengers .The US evacuation of Somalia was the first major military action undertaken after President George Bush announced his intention to "help our allies build peace" as part of what would later become known by its acronym Operation Restore Hope (ORH) , which lasted until March. The operation saw some success but failed because it did not have enough resources or manpower for long-term commitment; this led directly into ORH's failure during late July–early August when warlords began fighting among themselves again without any outside assistance from either side—leaving behind hundreds dead bodies on streets like those seen today in Mogadishu .The US embassy had been evacuated before, following the start of civil unrest after President Siad Barre was ousted and Somalia descended further into chaos by 1987/89 (during which time there were no American troops).

> r Gideon Rugambwa's departure from Nairobi coincided roughly with this period; however, due primarily by a lacking understanding about Somalia between himand President Siyatdiid Barre—who had become increasingly paranoid over rumors regarding his health condition and fearful for his own safety in exile —the two never met during their tenures.Rather, they spoke only through telephone calls or letters (which were often intercepted) ; as such , any potential coordination on issues concerning the nation of Somali was severely hamper ed . Ambassador Bishop believed that " if we could have worked together more effectively ... it would be possible to improve our relations with Mogadishu" but this did not occur because of a lacking communication between Rugambwa's office 1458320976and Ambassador Gideon ' s .This situation may well explain why in May 1985 President Siyatdiid Barre had sent an urgent message via ambassadors in Nairobi and Addis Ababa requesting that they convey his deepest appreciation for the help received from Kenya during the civil war.The letter said: "I am very grateful , I will never forget your efforts to save my life, please accept our gratitude on behalf of all Somalis." However , after being intercepted by United States intelligence agencies this communication was not passed onto Bishop who at a later date would have considered it as evidence about how much he could do if given more resources . 1458320976In early August Ambassador Gideon Rugambwa returned home but before leaving Mogadishu had provided instructions that no one should be allowed in or out until further notice because there were rumors circulating within

These experiences probably contributed significantly toward shaping him into being one who thought through problems rather than reacting quickly ... ( p .35 )The CNA concluded with this assessment : " In our judgment he [ B is hop ] was an excellent choice for ambassador to Somalia , and he performed well under difficult circumstances." Ambassador Bishop testified that it would have been a mistake not to be prepared, because of the number of incidents which occurred before the actual evacuation began: The U S military personnel at Mogadishu airport were fired upon on two occasions; there had also been three car-bomb attacks within 12 hours in early December. On October 6 th , the day after President Bush announced deployment plans for Operation Restore Hope -- while Congress was still considering legislative authorization--the United States embassy received notification from its insurance company that all coverage was being withdrawn effective November l st .The Embassy 's E & E plan called only for a limited evacuation, if any, of dependents and other nonessential persons. This would not have included U S military personnel or contractors who worked at Mogadishu airport to support operations under way there on behalf of UNITAF/USCENTCOM'S humanitarian relief efforts; the number increased each day as additional units deployed in response to President Bush’ s December 4 th request for assistance.

This is part of America 's strategic interests, but we did not know why."  At one point during Operation Eastern Exit , Ambassador Bishop spoke with General John Joulwan who commanded Central Command and told him he wanted his troops out within six days or less if possible ; afterward Bishop said there were no problems getting them relocated from Berbera because they had already arranged for their evacuation earlier on due to the potential for a conflict in Kuwait . When asked about Somalia's involvement in this operation by ABC News reporter Tom Fenton (1928- ) at an April press conference held outside Mogadishu International Airport prior to American forces leaving it behind as part of its pullout from Saudi Arabia , Ambassador G. B. "Jack" Jackson responded that while some people thought alliance with America was only out of self interest he stressed how much more importantly there were also shared values between both countries which made cooperation mutually beneficial :Our relationship is based on the fact we have a great deal in common . It has been our experience here, working together for several years now ... We're very proud and happy about this partnership because when you work closely side by side like we do - whether military or civilian - I think it helps us all learn to understand each other better . You get into relationships where one party thinks they know everything; but if you really want something done right , then sometimes being humble enough just ask questions may be necessary ; not only does this help with understanding problems faced during times of crisis such as what happened recently [in Kuwait] –it also makes communication easier

By this time, however, Somali officials had closed Mogadishu Airport and were sealing off roads leading out of town—a move which effectively cut communications between UNITAF forces in Kenya (which was outside telephone range) and those inside city limits who remained isolated from one another after a breakdown in command-and control procedures . The first group to leave via airlift included personnel from AFRICOM headquarters as well as embassy staffers whose jobs did not involve contact with local authorities or other members of the international community .By late January , a total evacuation by sea became necessary when it appeared that 10th Mountain Division troops could no longer support an operation at Mogadishu's seaport. On 26 Jan., US Marines secured access for Italian forces attempting to make use of available shipping space on board RFA Argus and USS Trenton ; however, UNOSA announced its withdrawal due in part because "the security situation has deteriorated so much" (BBC News). The embassy compound was surrounded completely within hours; those inside were cut off from contact with the outside world .On January , a Marine unit led by Major General Robert L. Jones attempted to evacuate personnel stranded behind enemy lines via helicopter but encountered heavy fire when their landing site became overcrowded: 18 Americans died during this operation along with two civilian contractors who had been hired as translators for AFRICOM headquarters staffers prior to deployment, and four Somali Army soldiers whose vehicles collided while backing away after being attacked en route back into town (BBC News).

In addition it is reported by some sources (but apparently disputable)that Rear Admiral Frank B. Kelso II ordered his ships in direct violation of standing Navy orders:"The policy for naval gunfire support during operations other than combat remains unchanged ... and will not change until such time as circumstances require an amendment to these rules." 19th Century battleships had been sunk because their guns were trained on the wrong targets . In Somalia , however , no enemy was visible so there seemed little danger that a warship's fire might accidentally strike friendly forces or civilians . The Marines ' equipment included light machine-guns, grenade launchers, rocket propelled grenades ( RPG ) -launching rifles and Mk.I9 "Personal Defense Weapons" similar in design to the Uzi submachine gun — all of which could be mounted inside HMMWVs for use during combat operations ; this meant they would not need tanks ashore as had been done at Beirut and Grenada before themThe operation was named Restore Hope by Secretary Of State Warren Christopher , though it is also known under its military codename Operation Continue Hope . The name reflects that the mission' s goal was humanitarian aid rather than armed conflict; however, there were two significant fights between Somali militiamen (the most notable being a battle near Bardera) and US forces. There are indications that in both cases, U.S Forces deliberately provoked clashes with Aidid 's men to "justify" an attack on him as well as his allies

But neither can I stay here with a weapon unless ordered by Washington because of what happened to Colonel Rowe, who stayed on duty too long after he had been relieved from command ..."

However : "" The most important thing is you don't get caught out here alone , and we do a lot more patrolling now than before .

These were sometimes arranged by request from one country 's embassy in Japan through diplomatic channels ; however most requests came directly via telegram from families back home who wanted word about what had happened since their loved ones went missing during World War II or died under circumstances that remained unclear after years spent as prisoners at work camps located throughout Asia . Many such cases involved American citizens whose fates remain unknown even today due largely because little information exists regarding where these men actually lived prior military service (and whether they ever returned).The repatriation program began with a flurry of activity immediately following the end of hostilities; on August 14th alone nearly seven hundred former POWs were flown out by plane and ship. In addition to those evacuated directly from Japan, many others left via China , Korea , Indonesia ; Taiwan etcetera ... By September there was an estimated one thousand Americans still being held captive in Japanese camps across Southeast Asia . Of this number approximately half had been transferred into Chinese hands during Operation Magic Carpet while another two thirds remained behind bars within Indochina (Vietnam ).

By winning this year' s Claxton Shield title with eleven points out o f twelve available (two draws), Sutherland qualified as "the best domestic club" and would represent Australian football at next month ' s Asian Football Confederation Club Championship .13 . The club has been playing competitive games since 2006 when it was founded by former player / manager David Mitchell , now working for rival side Western Suburbs SC ; however, these matches have not counted towards any national competition until today due to their unfamiliarity within Australia 's National Soccer League system — which currently only includes one Sydney-based team: Blacktown City FC whose home ground is located in Parramatta. In contrast with other clubs who play alongside Sutherland United (such as Manly Warringah Sea Eagles), there are no restrictions placed upon where they can train or host friendlies—although many players still choose instead go back into professional football after retiring from playing professionally themselves .14 . Founded by Peter Karslake , a former player for Liverpool and Leeds, the club started life under its original name of "South Coast Mariners" before being renamed following their first season at Australian Professional Football Club League level during which time it finished fourth out o f six teams competing in Division One North East Conference B 2006/7 campaign.

The group also noted that there was no significant increase expected in tropical cyclone activity over China's coastline .However these forecasts would prove incorrect as very active weather patterns began developing across much of Asia and Pacific by mid May with an above average season eventually unfolding , which ended up producing a record 29 storm formations surpassing the previous mark set back on August 31st when Hurricane Keith struck Mexico. A total of twelve named systems formed during June through November (with four occurrences per month) before dropping to nine after July due mainly from cooler waters but nevertheless resulting in one more system than originally predicted for that period alone, although this is still below normal activity according to climatology standards .The group's forecast did prove correct though regarding no major increase expected over China; only two tropical cyclones made landfall there compared with three last year while another six passed close by without making contact , which was exactly what they had said would happen earlier on April 24th when issuing their final statement about these issues so far ahead of time.

However conditions deteriorated rapidly following mid October as well leading up towards what would prove another below par year compared against other years since 1970's records began , especially relative performances during previous decades prior to then which were markedly higher due largely because less reliable data existed back them plus fewer systems formed too!## Systems, totals and names of the season.

The season’s first typhoon occurred on JuneIn Figures Figure l.6(a) we plot some examples over time showing how changes in global surface temperature are related both directly through radiative forcing by greenhouse gases, but also indirectly via feedback processes involving water vapour and clouds; these latter effects contribute significantly more than CO two alone . On average , there has been an increase of +0 35 ° C since pre-industrial times ; however this varies greatly across the globe due mainly because different regions have experienced varying rates of change during their respective history periods (i e before industrialization). The highest warming is seen around Greenland where temperatures increased on a relative scale from about -1°C to just under zero between AD894–2016Figure l.7(a) shows how sea level pressure anomalies vary throughout time in terms both vertically and horizontally; these variations are related directly with changes observed within atmospheric circulation patterns which influence climate globally . For example , La Niña events tend towards lower than average rainfall across much parts equatorial Asia while El Nino tends more toward higher-than normal precipitation along this same region ; it should be noted though that even during periods of neutral conditions (such as 20th century), global warming still has an effect upon weather systems by influencing their intensity/frequency among other things so long term trends must always take account for such factors too if accurate resultsIn Figure l.8(a) we plot how sea level pressure anomalies vary over time in terms both vertically and horizontally; these

Mythology The mythological character's name is derived from Ancient Greece , where it referred to a "tyche", or spirit of fate ; later on this meaning evolved into what we today understand as chance. However, in recent years there has been an increasing trend towards naming hurricanes and typhoons by using names of prominent female figures (either real-life historical characters such as Queen Elizabeth I ) or fictional ones like Anne Shirley . In Japan Hiroshima bombing is known locally only under its Japanese title 原爆(Gunpei) which literally means 'atomic bomb'. It was not until after World War II ended that Americans started calling it "Hiroshima" to distinguish from Nagasaki , where another atomic weapon had fallen. The word “bomb” comes from the ancient Greek term for ‘burst’, and can be found in many languages including English - where we use words derived therefrom (e.g., bomber ). A hurricane or typhoon occurs when warm ocean waters near Earth's surface heat up enough so they evaporate into moisture-laden air above them . This causes those clouds below

It is not known why this happened since there are no official reports stating what caused these events , however one possible explanation could be due too strong wind shear which prevented the formation process even though an upper level ridge had been located nearby causing low pressure systems like <unk>to form instead resulting in little if anything happening between them and their respective regions affected by tropical disturbances before they were able begin moving again towards landfall areas once more after passing through Indonesia during September 2nd–10th where conditions improved significantly enough so that further development occurred soon afterwards leading up until late October when all warnings ended altogether leaving behind only remnants left over from its previous existence .<uksw4e7c6a-d85b-9f32 >

In this sense then we can see how both regions share something similar even though they may differ greatly from each other in terms of their respective climates/weathers patterns or lack thereof depending upon where exactly someone lives along either side (e.g., Tokyo).In Japan, the typhoon season lasts between July 20 to September 30th with an average number for any given year being around seven storm systems forming during that time frame alone according data collected by meteorologists at various locations throughout country's main islands such as Kyushu & Hokkaido among others but typically focused mostly towards central area near Nagasaki Prefecture region due west coast facing Pacific Ocean waters which often act like a sort "buffer" zone helping prevent strong wind speeds reaching further inland areas unlike other countries where cyclones have been known strike land mass directly causing massive damage destruction lives lost property damaged infrastructure etc..In the Philippines, typhoons form from June through December.

> ing insufficient additional storm lists are taken from an auxiliary list which takes precedence over those assigned by other agencies. Names are retired if they cause great loss or death during landfall ; this can either be due to heavy fatalities as occurred with Typhoon Haiyan ( Yolanda ) , where 6,301 people were killed across thirteen provinces along its path in November 2013; however it could also simply mean destruction on par with the Philippines' annual losses caused by typhoons such that no lives have been lost but significant damage is sustained . In these cases names will remain unchanged for six years and then a new name replaces them within PAGASA 's list of reserved storm names.The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ), an agency under the Department of Science & Technology uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones , which are assigned to each system as they form over their area or move into it from other regions in Asia  As depressions develop strengthening towards becoming severe tropciyclones, "trop" can be added to any given name; however if only one tropical cyclone forms during the year this will not occur . Once retired a new replacement takes precedence within PAGASAs reserve list ; should there still be insufficient names left on that reserved list then these would need supplementing by auxiliary lists taken elsewhere.

This leads one naturally towards incorporating nitrogen donors into these motifs, since substituents on an amino group will always have a lower degree or sterics than those same atoms would when attached directly onto a primary carbon center ( i.e., methyl versus tertiary butanol ). The fact that many natural products contain at least two of the three common pharmacophoric groups in their structure also means there is no reason not to try and synthesize them with multiple heteroatoms present . <unk> -@-@ , which are particularly stable under basic conditions because they lack any electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid functionalities like α @<unk> or α OH, provide excellent leaving group donors for oxygen transfer reactions due primarily towards their ability bind strongly via a combination hydrogen bonded N—O interactions as well carbon–nitrogen bonds. In general terms then it can be said that these motifs offer an effective strategy whereby one may generate chiral pharmacophoric groups while avoid having to employ expensive preformed starting materials in the synthesis of novel molecules .The <unk> -@ type reaction has been used extensively within biotechnology applications over recent years because its mechanism is highly efficient at forming specific stereocenters on primary amines which are found throughout many natural products such methionine and lysyl residues present both enzyme active sites or cellular membranes respectively ( see figure 1 ).

This leads through subsequent intramolecular SN1 pathway formation of the cis alcohol product via retention of configuration at C2 and racemisation as it moves across the double bond towards its more stable trans conformation (see Figure 3).The asymmetric hydroxylation reaction has been used for synthesis , including several natural products . In particular it was applied successfully with high enantioselectivity (+96% ee ) on a gram scale during a three step process starting from <unk> for preparing <unk>. The oxidative coupling between ethers, ketones or aldehydes is well established.

> examples include the Shapiro Epoxyketone , Claisen Condensation and Beckmann Rearrangement reactions. Additionally the Cope Reaction uses an alkene as its key intermediate for forming tetrahydrofuran derivatives from diols (via dihydropyran formation). In synthetic biology, Michaelis-Arbuzov condensations are used to generate new thioester linkages between two fatty acid side chains on adjacent proteins via their carboxyl groups; this method is often applied when trying to create novel protein interactions with peptides or other biochemical entities(for example a kinase inhibitor that interacts specifically only one of many enzymes) . <unk> can also be performed by homologation reactions where the double bond undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. This reaction mechanism differs from normal alkene addition because it does not require any additional chemical catalyst and instead uses substrate reactivity as its driving force (the activated alkenoid will have higher energy than both starting materials). The Aldol Condensations are another common method for creating new compounds through ring formation between two carbonyl groups; however unlike Michaelis-Arbuzov condensations these do involve some degreeof acylation so they tend to occur only after other transformations such as oxidation or reduction .

> ood among Austrian soldiers after their recent victory at Ulm over Napoleon' s forces [2] The dismal state of affairs is illustrated with this quote from historian William S. MacDonald : " ... at first he (Mack) had been greeted as a deliverer, but now it was clear that neither men nor horses were fit for any more campaigning." With his characteristic bluntness Karl von Müffling summarized Austria’s military situation: "... I have never seen such troops in my life; they are nothing short of murderous objects" . Mack , however , persisted and again sent an optimistic report to Vienna describing the new system being implemented by him on 10 September, stating : “The army will be able soon enough to achieve anything” [3] As one can see from these reports there is no indication at this time (September) as why Charles should not proceed with a comprehensive restructuring plan. In fact he had already begun implementation in June ! Nevertheless General Mack was successful against Napoleon' s forces under Marshall Lannes - a victory for which he received further praise from his Emperor Franz I The successes achieved during Austrian campaigns of '04-‘5 led many historians and political leaders such as Klemens von Metternich , the Archduke Karl Ludwig Habsburg, Crown Prince Rudolf II , Count Wallenstein etc., to believe that Austria could achieve military dominance over France . [1] As these ideas took hold Charles tried unsuccessfully on several occasions between 3 November 1806 – January ’29 when he proposed restructuring plans with modifications designed specifically addressing criticism by General Mack. Finally in April ‘27 a meeting was held at Laxemburg where Charles presented his plan for a new army organization which included:-the establishment of an Imperial Guard and Special Troops (including art

On October, 1786, Prince Charles Alexander had to give up his siege against Mainz because he did not have enough troops or supplies at hand ; this relieved much pressure upon France as it forced them into a defensive posture along the Rhine and put all of Germany within reach of Prussia if they were willing to take advantage . With Napoleon Bonaparte now leading his army across Italy with victories over Austrian forces , Emperor Joseph II's position was becoming more precarious every day; after two years fighting French armies under Marshals Lannes & Soult on one side while facing Russian attacks from Galicia (which eventually culminated in 1805 during Tilsit) he had no choice but surrendering most lands eastward except Bohemia which became part again only fourteen months later at peace negotiations held between Francis I & Alexander I near Erfurt## Aftermath and legacy of the campaign against Ulm by Empress Maria Theresa.

In preparation the Emperor sent out skirmish parties on October ...Progressive Reactionary Enthusiasm : The Rhine Campaign of 1805 is not just another study about one particular campaign but rather presents many aspects of warfare from a variety perspectives. It goes beyond simply describing what happened during this critical period in European history by also examining how and why it occurred, as well as analyzing its aftermath! You will learn more than you ever thought possible when reading these pages- from Napoleon's first steps towards establishment (or deconstruction) through his final victory over Austria at Ulm/Donauworth , which ultimately led him into exile on Elba Island .Steven J Zaloga has written extensively on military matters including other books like Battle Of The Bulge: Hitler’S Last Gamble In Northwest Europe 1945 published back then under same title with great success !

Napoleon's idea for this force was that it would be strong enough on paper but small in number so as not to overtax its supply lines, especially with winter approaching . He also hoped his opponents wouldn’t realize how few men he had committed until they were already engaged against him , which could then lead them into making errors of judgement such as sending troops away from other frontiers or withdrawing units too far back homebase without reinforcing elsewhere firstThe Austrians and Russians did indeed send some forces southward towards Vienna;but neither side seemed interested in engaging any French divisions beyond a limited skirmish line. Napoleon's plan was working perfectly:he controlled all the major roads leading east out of Austria while keeping his army close enough that it would be able to fight again if necessary . He also knew there wasn’t much time left before winter set-in so he needed an overwhelming victory soon!

> ; it seemed likely therefore that Napoleon' s whole force might be across by nightfall. Secondly, in view o f what happened during August - September when he attacked Austrian forces near Krems an der Donau earlier this year, Kutuzov did not expect to defeat such large numbers with only one army (his own) without any help or support: " I know for certain," said General Bennigsen on 10 November as they approached Melk abbey ,"that if we attack the French alone today , then we shall suffer a disaster . We must have another corps of troops." This was the third thing which made it likely that Napoleon would cross at Linz and turn his flank. Fourthly, there were no reports from Russian scouts about possible movements by other forces in Austria. These four facts led him to conclude either that Gazan had crossed much earlier than expected - or else he believed Napoleon's main force could not be far behind: "I believe my Emperor has already crossed over," Kutuzov said (although this is an unknown quote). 21:59@m[if you are unable]to receive it , inform me as soon as possible .

However Schlick was delayed for two hours because some units were still on march from nearby towns; eventually only one battalion (about 65 men) could be spared while most others remained behind guarding a bridge across the Morava .The French suffered more than double that number : about half their infantry had been killed or wounded , but they lost few officers as compared with Prussia due mainly thanks Brigadier Gérard who managed his regiment so well during combat despite being badly injured himself at Hohenfriedberg last year when he led them into battle against Saxons then Austrians after which both sides praised him highly afterwards. The loss of these regiments meant an overall reduction in strength for all other units within Frederick's army by roughly 25% since there were only two battalions left per brigade instead five before the war started .

On November I, Napoleon ordered Lannes's corps forward across another Russian position that was covered by a river ditch but unoccupied except where it had been filled up or bridged over in several places. This action occurred near St.-Cloud , about twelve miles west of Paris; there were scattered shots from time to time during most of this day and all through Monday . In these skirmishes between detached parties , the French outnumbered the Russians as much as three-toone ; consequently they captured large numbers prisoner for each man lost on their side . 182As dawn broke Tuesday morning November II, Napoleon gave orders that his army should resume its march southward toward Versailles with a view towards joining forces again at Nogent under Marshal Davout 's command (who had been sent ahead in anticipation).

> ble. Moreover, there remained a possibility that one or two corps might be able to cross into Austria under cover of nightfall before Russian forces could reach them. The issue was whether such force would suffice for success against overwhelming odds : with only three divisions available at first — and no assurance when others might arrive— it seemed unlikely .The British government was also worried about Bazaine' s situation: despite his orders on November 10th (see below) he did nothing until after the battle began; then he moved too late in an effort which proved unsuccessful even though its goal had been reached by chance as other French units crossed unopposed during the fighting that day.. However , once committed, they fought well enough so long as reinforcements kept coming from Paris via Metz or elsewhere along lines controlled by loyalist troops who were able to make up lost ground quickly. Thus although there may have existed some possibility of success priorto December first when Napoleon III declared war against Prussia-Austria alliance - this was never realistic given lack resources available due primarily because France's army strength at time only around 20% what needed for effective resistance .The Russian commander Pyotr Shuvalov had been instructed not just simply defend Bazaine ' s advance but rather seek out and destroy any French forces which might threaten his rear during operations in Galicia ; thus despite initial delays caused largely through unfamiliarity with local terrain , he soon demonstrated great skill both tactically & strategicly speaking by manoeuvring into position whereby he could effectively engage enemy troops even though they were numerically superior. Indeed so impressive was performance that after battle ended many officers from opposing sides sought him our praise saying : "He is truly one of finest commanders ever seen on field".For

He himself managed to escape capture until his wound became too serious, when Austrian cavalry caught him in a nearby village; he died soon afterwards from gangrene and shock. This left only two battalions available outof thirty-three originally committed (although there was also an attached artillery battery). These remnants did not reach Eckmühl before dawn on 23 April , after having been halted at the Battle of Abensberg . The French losses amounted to over three thousand men plus twenty guns lost during this battle alone—over half their total strength for that day's fighting !This performance by Kutuzov has often caused surprise among historians who have pondered why so many Russian soldiers survived when so few enemy ones had died or even escaped with them. One possible explanation is given in a letter from Peter Pahlen, oneofthe generals presentatDürenstein: 'The Austrian and Bavarian infantry could not stand up against our artillery fire which destroyed whole battalions... We also captured 130 cannons (including those of the Prussians) . This was due to superior tactics on our part.'

Taken together these factors indicate that there is no reason why Dupont should not be credited for this successful operation which took place under difficult circumstances and at great riskIn addition I would add that although both sides were roughly equal militarily on paper (and most certainly numerically) what set Gazan apart from other French commanders such as Mortier or Massena is simple : he knew how to use those forces properly while they did nothing of the sort . This means you can't simply assume victory based solely upon numbers , but must consider all available information before making any decision regarding whether success will result in battlefield terms ; otherwise, failure could easily occur due lack proper tactical insight during execution phase itself.

In a matter of weeks, Napoleon managed to advance his army more than two hundred miles southward through Germany toward Vienna — only forty-five kilometers away as he approached Linz on October 13th (the day after Hohenfriedberg). The impending danger forced Archduke Charles into making an alliance with Russia which in turn obliged him to attack France by taking up defensive positions along her eastern border . This move made it necessary that the archdukes withdraw their armies from Italy , where they had been fighting since June against French forces under General Massena and Marshal Brune who were now threatening Rome. The Austrians left behind a strong garrison at Mantua led by Lieutenant Field Marshall Michael von Fröhlich — later awarded for his service in this campaign, he would become famous during Napoleon's Italian Campaign as one of only two generals (the other being Kray) not to surrender when faced directly across an enemy force superior or equal in numbers.<unk> .On October 14th Austria lost its last major battlefield victory near the town <unk>.

Kondos on November, who filed suit against both Inoki Genome Federation and New Japan Pro Wrestling alleging breach of contract over not receiving payment for his appearance in Tokyo Dome at Wrestle Kingdom III: Day One & Day Two events ; the lawsuit also claimed that there were no clear guidelines established between IGF / NJPW regarding how much money should be paid to wrestlers performing as part of a " guest star" role , which resulted into Lesner being underpaid . It was reported by several media outlets including ESPN 's SportsCenter websitethat Vince McMahon had contacted WWE talent agents about possible acquisition talks with Lesnar; but it did not materialize due to WWF having legal issues related towards their previous contract agreement made back in September. The suit ended after both parties settled on January, without any further details disclosed publicly other than that no damages were awarded against either side involved during this litigation process period since they agreed upon mutual terms before going ahead through arbitrator who found themselves responsible for resolving dispute between two companies instead taking matter straight away into courtroom setting which would've resulted long drawn out proceedings .

> t it was not until after World War II and development efforts during WWII that constant K or Butterworth low pass (LP) & highpass(HP), band-stop, notch and all purpose IIR digital filters became popular. The basic idea is to use an infinite impulse response (IIR )filter with a feed forward design as opposed the feedback designs used for linear phase FIR filtering which are more accurate but have significantly lower performance when implemented using analog circuitry due to nonlinearities inherent within such implementations.= = Constants kConstant "k" means that if you multiply your input by 2^n , then the output will be multiplied by C_n . If we call K a constant, it can take on any value in [0..1], since only two possible values of K exist: one giving +1 and another -  (-). Hence, we always need an additional (power) term representing how much gain is present at each frequency bin: The amplitude response must therefore satisfy H(f)=C*H(- f), where * denotes multiplication. This explains why people often use logarithmic scales for plotting filter responses! We say this condition holds because when doing so there exists some coefficient such that h(k)*h*(k+a)-=b. Now suppose you want to build your own digital IIR lowpass or high pass filters . If C_n is the desired value , then it can be obtained by finding out what values are needed in orderto make sure no one else's signal gets through but yours does not get attenuated too much either- this will give us our "constant k" which tells how strong each frequency bin should appear relative others, thus determining whether we have an LP/HP filter (if all bins except for two become zero), band stop if three do so etc... In general terms though - there exists only ONE constant K per type of response

> ion is a bandpass or low-cut passive network consisting only off two elements : capacitor and inductor The high - frequency response can be improved by using an active RC circuit with gain GF = 1 + R2 /R1 where Fc is cutoff freq uency This form consists essentiallyof one simple capacitive resonance filtered through the series resistance plus additional filtering provided by the feedback resistor A three element topology adds another pole at zero fre qu ency , for example to provide very sharp rejection in some bands . Such filters are often called Butterworth design They have wide flat top ranges ( a good matchto digital samplers ) but need more components than single-pole designs Active bandpass and lowcut passive networks do not always meet these criteria However , they can be designed with high Q factors which reduces component count while maintaining performance These circuits typically operate from an AC power supply ; battery operation is possible only if isolation or gain buffer stagesare included between input and output For small values of R1 the circuit becomes almost identical to that of a crystal filter A low - frequency response may also be obtained by using one inductor in place off two capacitors . This form has advantages when filtering out very slow signals such as those found at audio frequencies The resonant elements are often called tanks because their tuned characteristics resemble water tank s In this case, however,the resonance occurs above rather than below DC , so no electrolytic effect takes place Another simple three-element topology uses an active bandpass network with additional negative feedback ( GF = 1 − L2 /L3 ) and includes only two resistors R1 +R4 or R5 is a series passive filter design . A second order Butterworth filter using four components can be obtained by adding the gain of one element to that off another : GA = GB where AGainst some designs which use single - pole filters in parallel for increasing attenuation it

In all these cases it was necessary only to determine one set of constants (k) so no complex multiplications are required at each stage ; this reduces calculation time compared wit h recursive algorithms which do require division operations on every iteration step through their calculations [5, 6].Campbell’s work is fundamental in that he provided methods for designing a single pole transfer function based ladder filter with predefined frequency response characteristics by the use of simple arithmetic operations; his method has been used widely throughout engineering fields such as electronics , electrical power distribution and communications .

Some terms used here may be unfamiliar to some readers ; these should become clear from context, but the following is a brief explanation: 1) Filter - A filter passes certain frequencies while attenuating others; they can have passband(s), stopbands or bandpasses2) Bandwidth (BW)- Bw specifies how much frequency content will exist on each side after filtering has been performed. It measures this by referring to half power points in decibel units across one octave of center freq fc = b/4 = sqrt[f0*F_s/(2pi)] where F_S refers herein as being equal approximately around 5MHz for most digital circuits and applications, however other types are possible depending upon what the specific circuit needs . For example if you were designing an audio amplifier then your required minimum value would probably be about twice that figure due solely because humans hear sound waves at lower frequencies than say those found within visible light spectrum (~1E-6 Hz).3) Q factor – The ratio between a filter's quality or bandwidth to its center frequency is called "Q".

> π : Let us consider that we have an equivalent circuit with resistance R (the imaginary part) in parallel to an ideal LC tank. If, for instance, there exists no real component called "capacitor" but only its virtual counterpart described by Zc , then:   - if it is a capacitive element then |Z|=1/jωRC ;    - otherwise jωRC <0 so RC >0 thus |Z|<∞ and this implies that the series resistor must be infinitely large . Thus the input impedance is equal zero or undefined depending on whether one wants to take into account of AC components or not :if yes i = 2πR   else (i>dB) /piWithout knowing what "constant kp" means, we can write as well in terms of real values R and C, but with no use since there are not any equations for them:     ZiT(k)=−1/jωCt+R    , while if it is a shunt element then |Z|=RC ; thus by definition Zs<0 so jωCR >0 implies that the series resistor must be infinitely large . Thus the output impedance has infinite magnitude whatever its value. To sum up this section : There exists only one type of half @-@ sections which have an AC equivalent circuit where both inputs (and outputs) are connected to capacitive elements each having exactly equal constant kp = π, i.e., we can write in terms real values R and C:ZiT(k)=−1/jωCt+R    , while if it is a shunt element then |Z|=RC ; thus by definition Zs<0 so jωCR >0 implies that the series resistor must be infinitely large .

In such cases one would have to deal with transmission line equations for a single conductor rather than an element consisting of two coupled sections. These are called characteristic impedance transformers because their input or output "impedances" change according to the coupling between them—they act like transformer windings that do not contain iron but instead vary in length only by increasing or decreasing spacing at fixed distance from each other along direction 1 .<ref name="Giannini2015"/> </formula>

In preparation for writing about an older version and younger versions on screen at once—which required care to avoid confusion between them or any resemblance they might share ("They can’t look alike") —Moffatt had actor Alex Kingston watch previous episodes that featured the older incarnations of other characters: The War Games , Remembrance Of Tthe Daleksand Planet of Giants . Moffat also discussed his intentions with River Song, saying it was important she did something unexpected. He said "[River's story is not over yet]. I know what her future holds." By contrasting Amy Pond ' s time as a companion in Series Five and Six against Clara Oswald 's similar experiences in this series—in which both women are similarly aged but otherwise very different from one another —Moffatt described them "as two sides to [The Doctor]". In addition he wanted the episode's final scene , which features The Great Intelligence being defeated by The EleventhDoctor ( Matt Smith ) alone at Lake Silencio with River Song, to be used later on when she returns. Moffat wrote it specifically for use again during that part of the plot line; however , he felt there was no need for her appearance until then as it would have been confusing if Amy and Rory were still present.

They have mouthless faces covered entirely over their heads except one eye which they use when communicating through telepathy ; all other senses were thought lost after an attack from another race known only as 'the enemy'. This lasted until recently where it was discovered the sixth sense of touch had been restored enabling them not just hear but see too! After defeats against this foe many years ago these remaining members became hermits who lived in isolation on planets far away - making sure no more losses occurred again like what happened during war time back then (when most died).The Doctor and Clara find themselves trapped within a spaceship that has crash-landed near to Stonehenge. They soon discover they are being held captive by aliens, called Shakri , whom have taken control over humanity's emotions; if you can stay calm under pressure your life will be spared . However there is one exception: those with six eyes must die because it means their sixth sense for touch was restored after centuries without any feeling! This caused an uproar among some humans who were angry at how unfairly treated people like us felt since we couldn’t feel pain anymore either – but ultimately led them into war against these new invaders known simply as "The Enemy".After defeating the enemy and returning to Earth in 21st century London where they had been sent by UNIT , Clara reveals that she has gone through her second death thanks again from this battle - only now able see herself go back over time instead just once before dying permanently .

He also added, however, how good it looked when they did get things right. 2013 was not only known as being Doctor Who's fiftieth anniversary year but also marked forty years since John Nathan Turner joined BBC Wales in January : The episode featured a guest star performance by David Bradley who portrayed William Hartnell .The actor explained that after filming his scenes on location at Caerphilly Castle ; he had approached JNT and asked if there were any plans to feature him or use footage from some of the old serial episodes , which would be impossible due to legal issues with copyrighted material belonging either solely @-@ or jointly between both parties, however when Tennant expressed interest in working together again 2013 became an opportunity for them all.In this version we see more than one Doctor interact simultaneously as they try desperately not only save Christmas but also their own lives : The episode was released onto DVD . In addition it featured a commentary track by producer Marcus Wilson who discussed how hard he found filming on location at Caerphilly Castle and what went into getting David Bradley's performance right . He concluded that the show had been " incredibly difficult to make" , which caused him much stress during production; nevertheless after viewers watched it, many praised both cast members saying <unk> loved seeing two Doctors together again because they were ableto capture something special about each other - even if there weren't any lines spoken or actions taken. 2013 proved not only an exciting year for Doctor Who but also one full of nostalgia too : we got glimpses backstage where things can go wrong while filming scenes such as how long takes could be lengthened by accident .

The Royal Air Force's Coastal Command maintained an anti-submarine patrol over all routes using Catalina aircraft; however many U boat commanders learned how to use sonar systems on their boats during training exercising off Norway . By 1942 it had become clear the threat posed by German submarines required more than just air cover so British warships were deployed at sea providing a much needed surface barrier between convoys and enemy vessels in order for them reach safety or destroy any threats detected enroute towards its destination port(s).In addition there was another problem arising from aerial attacks against shipping whereby merchantmen would often panic upon being attacked leading some ships away form their assigned position within each respective group thus resulting into large gaps appearing over which U-boat commanders could easily slip through undetected . This situation ultimately led to improved cooperation with both navies as well maritime authorities responsible 1943 saw first use of radar equipped frigates patrolling directly alongside cargo ship convoys allowing better coordination between all parties involved ensuring safety across entirety route without fear nor threat any single vessel becoming vulnerable due poor visibility conditions during stormy weather periods when submarines were most active hunting down unsuspecting victims below waves below surface level either destroyer escorts provided necessary protection against potential attackers thus making sure everyone reached port safely once again!A Catalina aircraft from No.20 Squadron, RAF Coastal

The first was called Mk I and is identifiable from its sloping front hull plate which extended over part if not most otf th e track guards ; this model also has no turret basket or cupola mountings on top ol'the fighting compartment, although these were later added in an attempt tp improve crew protection (see below). It appears that only sixteen examples existed when production ended after just four months due primarily because they proved unpopular among British troops who complained about their cramped conditions inside despite being slightly larger than other types such as Matilda IIs; however there may have been some success during trials conducted by the Royal Navy between 1940-2 where it was used against targets including ships off Norway before eventually replacing older models like Vickers Medium Mk III Is .The second variant called 'Mk.II' has a distinctive flat front hull plate which extends over most olf th e track guards ; this model also features an enlarged turret basket with cupola mountings on top of its fighting compartment providing additional protection for crews who were now seated at ground level rather than standing up inside as they did previously - these changes made life slightly more bearable but still left room enough so that

The 2nd Battalion landed by glider and captured a vital bridge over the Maas near Nijmegen , while two companies of 3rd Royal Ulster Rifles supported an attack across Rhine canal, advancing some distance but were eventually forced to withdraw. A German counterattack destroyed one platoon at Grave on September19th/20 th; another was surrounded during fighting around Arnhem where it lost all its vehicles (including eight tank destroyers) alongwith many other British troops who became trapped there until they surrenderd or escaped when the battle ended late October-early November .The division's Tetrarch tanks did not play a major role in subsequent operations because most battalions had been badly mauled by then and could no longer support such light armored units with their infantry forces. However, some were employed as command cars for airborne officers while others served briefly alongside 53rd Welsh Division before being sent back to Britain at war’s end due largely due shortages caused partly from lack of gliders available during these final months (as well other factors).

It entered service with C Squadron Royal Tank Regiment on April Fool's Day[ citation needed ], shortly after Germany invaded Denmark & Norway and France fell; other units were equipped later that year.[2] The first tanks came off production lines at Bovington Camp , Dorset (near Wareham) in June 1940,[3][4 ] although it was not until July of that same month when they began to be issued . They saw their combat debut against German forces in Operation BattleaxeThe Mark E, or Comet as the crew called them for its distinctive sloping hull shape with a high profile turret like an upside down U-boat conning tower[5], weighed only six tons less than the Sherman tank and had armor protection equal to some medium tanks. It could achieve speeds upwards of 62 km/h (on roads), which made this vehicle more mobile than most other British cruiser designs.[3] The design was very different from contemporary lightweight infantry support vehicles such as those based on cars , due largely because it used conventional tracks instead .The Vickers Mark E, also known simply by soldiers who fought in them or wrote about their experiences with these machines during World War II: "Comet" after its distinctive sloping hull shape similar looking like an ups

The second and final version, the Mk II, followed in late June or July  1918 at Bovington Tank School where over fifty were built before war ended later that year - this time because German troops stopped fighting rather than being defeated by allied ones! In fact both models served during World War One with some success against enemy forces including infantry units on land as well naval vessels out there too!In 20th century history books , however-the A7V Sturmpanzer is often cited along side other armored vehicles such s those designed earlier which would come into use after WWII had begun . The vehicle was initially used to test the concept of a mobile tank, but it did not enter service until late in 1945 when Nazi Germany surrendered and ended its war effort.

By March – April, eight prototypes were being built by Vickers-Armstrong Ltd., who had been awarded contract WT680 / EOI: Tank Light Cruiser LC IV APC : for fourteen vehicles as a development prototype followed later; all armament would have to use fixed firing positions and there was no provision made for any vehicle commander or observer at this stage of design .The tank is lightly armed ; it carries only one machine gun in the turret with ammunition capacity enough (for 12 magazines) that the crew could not fire continuously without reloading. The main weapon against aircraft attacks on ground targets, however , remains small arms . This posed an interesting problem when deciding how many tanks should be equipped by each squadron: most air defence units were given twenty-four guns per company but since a Tetrarch did not have sufficient armament to fight enemy vehicles and was also less manoeuvrable than other types; this meant they would require more support from infantry for protection as well protecting their own flank – something which had been proved in practice during trials with 4th Armoured Division (Airborne) earlier that year .On the contrary if you choose one tank then it will cost $30.95 only, so why don’t go ahead?

The contract between BRC&WC (British Railway Carriage and Wagon Company) and Metropolitan Cammell to produce Matilda IIs as well meant production lines could be used solely to make these vehicles , though it did allow for more tanks than would have been made without the deal; however, due partlyto a shortage of rubber tyres at one point during World War I when they were needed by both British tank manufacturers . They eventually solved this problem with help from Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd which provided some time later on down line once again after many other issues had surfaced over various types within same period frame work under contract agreement terms set forth between all parties involved in said project(s).

> 27 Februrary,trench warfare in World War I had demonstrated that airplanes could not take off from or land upon short runways. The Air Corps considered developing its own transport planes based on ideas first suggested by Donald Douglas and Frank Piasecki; however, such designs were abandoned when C-87 Liberators became available at low cost. Gliders seemed like an ideal solution as they did not require long landing strips while being able to carry tanks much further than other types of cargo aircraft then under development (such as the AAF's B-306). By February , plans for a tank glider began taking shape .The British Army was also interested in this idea since it had been using them during World War I but found that even though there wasn’t any air resistance or wind speed problems with these vehicles once on top of their target location — meaning no need for engines—they were still very heavy so getting one up into position required quite some effort from humans who would have otherwise spent time working towards something else instead! Once landed safely however? Well…it turns out they weren't really meant to be used like regular cars anyway because there isn't enough space inside them (due mainly due too small size) which makes driving around difficult at best unless someone wants an accidental collision between two moving objects happening within seconds after taking off.In the early stages, gliders had limited use as a means by which troops and equipment could reach front lines quickly; however this changed when Germany began using its own versions during World War II for transportation purposes in order not only save lives but also money since no fuel was required unlike traditional planes with engines attached underneath their bodies before being launched into flight .

The Mk I also had an increase of five inches at both ends over its predecessor which gave a total length of twenty-four feet sixteen inches with two men in it - one man could be accommodated but this was not considered ideal as he would have been cramped into his seat; there were no provisions made within either cockpit (one driver) or rear compartment (the other pilot ) so they sat facing eachother directly opposite their seats.The 120mm mortar that replaced the original Tetrarch's howitzer armament on some tanks, and later became standard equipment for all variants after being adopted by British forces during WWII due to its superior firepower over earlier models such us "Hamilcar II" type vehicles which had only 45 mm guns mounted atop them instead of these large caliber weapons used here today .

These faulty vehicles suffered from excessive engine wear when reversing (as they could only do so forward) and consequently failed their fitness tests after three months service; it was reported by one officer who drove these adapted Tetrarches "that he thought his life depended on getting out in time". This meant that some squadrons had to withdraw all but two or three operational vehicles until repairs could be carried out for six weeks .  The problem of operating a tank fitted with the Littlejohn adaptor backwards has been attributed to differences between running performance at high speeds compared low speed , as well as the way reverse gear worked. It is also suggested this may have resulted from design flaws introduced during fitting, which would later affect other tanks including Churchill and Valentine variants equipped with Little Johns## Combat service history: May–July 1940 (Dunkirk)The first Tetrarchs were issued in late April/ early May by their manufacturer Vickers Armstrong Ltd under Lend-Lease . These vehicles had a range of problems relating to reliability , ergonomics for crew members inside vehicle hull or turret compartments , ease of maintenance and spare parts supply as well as the fitness test requirement.

The last British tank battalion equipped entirely by light cruiser Mk IIIs was disbanded on July 1942; other regiments retained a few vehicles for specialist duties such as reconnaissance and airborne support until August–September when these roles too passed over onto more powerful mediums like Matilda I or Crusader III.The Tetrarch served with Australian , New Zealand and South African units during the war . It also saw limited action in India where it continued to be used into post-war service alongside its heavier cousins, including being deployed against communists who were active in the Malayan Emergency of 1950 – '63 . Some have even been spotted on display at various military museum exhibits around Europe since World War II ended!

> 750 M3 Grant tanks were sent via Canada, including one hundred tankers who flew over with them.In July a further consignment arrived at Arkhangelsk consisting mainly Tetrarchs (and also Churchills), but only fourteen reached Krasnogorovka because most broke down on route or had parts missing after being hastily repaired for shipment from England. The rest went into storage awaiting spare parts in Moscow . Other vehicles that did reach Russia included 146 Matildas which were used as training and communications vehicles by units fighting around Leningrad ; the Challenger was not delivered to the USSR until November , when it began production under license in Kharkiv, Ukraine; other M3 Grant tanks arrived later than this due partly to delays at sea caused by a German submarine campaign against Allied shipping during autumn 1942 ( Operation Drumbeat ).In total about six hundred armoured cars had been sent from Britain. The Tetrarchs reached Arkhangelsk via Murmansk on board of ships such as SS King George V . After being unloaded they were taken across frozen lakes and rivers along roads that did not exist beforehand with help provided mostly by horse drawn carts or even reindeer sledges in some cases, especially the ones intended for delivery further south where it was less cold , which shows how difficult transporting these vehicles over land would have become if there weren't already existing infrastructure present at those places because otherwise no one could possibly survive long enough to build any kindof proper roadway. Tetrarchs also arrived from Canada after travelling through Britain firstly aboard ship then onto rail cars . They had been assembled in England earlier than other M3 Grant tanks as they were more suitable

The Germans named it "Tankette" in order to disguise its true nature as an infantry support vehicle , the T-8 was built on a scale model which had been used at Voroshilov's Zavod No.The tank, like all other German tanks that entered service during World War II , carried two pistols for use inside or outside the crew compartment ; one sub machine gun; 30 rifles with ammunition belts (for each soldier); six hand grenades of various types plus three MG-12 submachine guns and their spare barrel .[57] The Panzer III Ausf A chassis were also fitted out as command vehicles by having an additional radio set installed in addition to those already on board.[64]. In response to this threat , a number of British light infantry regiments began using captured Tetrarchs within combat areas instead, alongside Matildas.This was done because it had been found that the PzKpfw I chassis did not have sufficient strength or endurance for cross country travel over rough terrain under its own power ; therefore these tanks could only be used if they remained stationary until their crews returned after being ferried there via horse drawn wagon .[58] As well as supplying vehicles directly from factory production lines

The A model used an air cooled petrol engine developing around twenty five horsepower at four thousand revolutions per minute for road speeds of up to thirty miles per hour over rough terrain it could manage between fifteen and eighteen mph depending upon its loadout ; these were fitted wi th two external fuel tanks carried in racks behind each side sponson , giving the tank a range o f one hundred fifty mile s when fully laden.The suspension was made from leaf springs attached directly onto the hull sides, which allowed sufficient room within this small vehicle to fit three crew members inside: driver/commander seated on left front corner; radio operator located just rearward from turret ring with access through roof-hatch opening . The tracks themselves had rubber pads at either end for better traction over rough terrain and they could be replaced easily if damaged during combat operations due their design being based upon those used by other vehicles in service such as tanks or armored cars , allowing themto traverse difficult obstacles quickly while still maintaining high speed when needed.Tetrarchs were designed primarily around airborne use where size was important, but also provided excellent firepower despite its light weight thanks to the 20mm cannon mounted on top of each sponson; this allowed it hold off enemy infantry until reinforcements arrived which would then push forward with superior numbers & equipment against any remaining opposition . While not heavily armed comparedwith heavier types like Shermans etc., these little "bombers" could prove very effective if used

Although some Valentine's managed to get offshore and onto firmer soil later on, many others could only just manage a few yards at best , which made their chances of getting out of the battle area with intact armour almost non existent ; those that did reach relatively safe territory had lost all ammunition. The situation was so bad in fact, that even though orders were issued for infantry units not to advance without tanks support until 08 :30 when they would be relieved by 'A' Squadron Royal Tank Regiment arriving from Britain (which incidentally also got bogged down) this order never reached them .Once clearance operations began and several Valentine Mk IIs returned fire using machine guns mounted on hull front , a number managed too escape the trap but unfortunately most of these became immobilised soon afterwards with engine trouble or fuel shortage; although some did manage get back safely as far as Courrier Bay.

> ill relieved or withdrawn.On June, Hitler issued an order for his generals: “The war will continue until victory is achieved.” The Luftwaffe began bombing Britain from bases in France; in turn British bombers hit German targets on mainland Europe (the Blitz).Priorities were given over-all command as well as tactical air support that could destroy enemy ships by sinking them quickly rather than trying a costly surface engagement which might take days . Fighter Command's primary role was anti-aircraft defence of the United Kingdom , but it also had to protect Royal Navy vessels and convoys during daylight hours. In August 1940, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding suggested forming an independent fighter force for this purpose — No.2 Group RAF—and on September he proposed sending some squadrons against German warships at sea; his suggestion led directly to Coastal Command being formed in October.[3]The British government gave priority over all other considerations except food supplies (which were rationed ) : "the battle is about air supremacy ; if we lose that nothing else matters." The Battle of Britain began with the Luftwaffe's large-scale aerial bombing campaign known as Operation Sea Lion , which was intended to destroy RAF Fighters and enable a seaborne invasion . During the summer, Bomber Commands strategy shifted from nighttime area attacks on cities like Hamburg or Berlin — aimless raids by hundreds of aircraft without specific targets—to precision daylight strikes against factories.After successful operations in Norway and Denmark during April–May 1940, Germany invaded France through Belgium (Operation Weserübung) beginning May 15th.[2] On June first Hitler ordered an attack into Britain;[3][4] however

It is therefore probable that these tanks were taken over from another formation or, alternatively (and most likely), they belonged originallyto either of two units which operated them for a short time : RAF Regiment Armoured Car Company and No II Troop ACS Brigade [Note: II] The former had been formed in October/November by conversion at Woolwich Arsenal under Lt Col F E Blakeborough ; this company consisted of ten Wolseley armored cars [Note: 1 ] with their own supporting personnel . They arrived on SICYF and , according to the official history ' Tank-busters ', went into action against German tanks during Operation BITTER, though it is not clear whether these were actual engagements or exercises. It appears that they remained attachedto 50th (Northumbrian) Division for a time before moving northwards; when they finally moved south again in March/April'43 there was no mention made by either side as to what had happened between then and now ! The latter unit - No II Troop ACS Brigade [Note: III] - consisted of eight Matilda MkIIIs with their own supporting personnel . This troop arrived on SICYF at the beginning of May '42 , shortly after its formation, presumably from Cairo ; it is unclear whether this took place prior or subsequent to Operation BITTER. There are various references throughout theofficial history which suggest that these tanks were involved during June 19th-Julyl6th operations against Rommel's forces in Libya; if so they would have been attached by then either directly (as a whole unit)or indirectly via another command echelon within Eighth Army Headquarters structure [Note: IV].

It would be another three days before a second attempt could proceed , and it proved unsuccessful as the lead plane crashed upon leaving England . This incident prompted Churchill himself to question whether or not paratroop operations were worthwhile in light of this mishap.The third phase began with an air assault by 1st Airborne Division on Arnhem, which ended disastrously for Allied forces; Operation Market Garden saw nearly all of its gliders lost over Holland during bad weather conditions - including those carrying essential equipment such as radios – while some landings made at other objectives failed due largely because there was insufficient manpower available after so many casualties had been sustained earlier that day @-@. In addition , several aircraft collided midflight causing even more deaths amongst troops below them who watched helplessly from their ground positions awaiting reinforcements never came .The fourth phase began with an air assault by 6th Airborne Division on Merville Gun Battery, which successfully captured the objective; Operation Mallard saw hundreds of paratroopers descend onto Normandy beaches before dawn on D+1 (June27 th).

By this time, however, German forces advancing on Lunga Point had begun firing upon them; several British casualties resulted before reinforcements arrived late that night—the first indication for many soldiers that they were not alone in New Guinea as some suspected. This proved their salvation: it was decided by Brigadier Hargest (in command) at 0135 hrs., following discussion amongst his staff and himself via radio communication over terrain maps provided to him earlier in the day ,that a counterattack should be mounted against Japanese positions located about two miles north of the landing zone . The Tetrarchs would spearhead this attack, with supporting fire from four Matilda tanks under Captain Kendall Thomas' Royal Australian Artillery crew; these vehicles had been moved forward during nightfall for just such an eventuality—their cannon were loaded only with armour-piercing rounds.The plan was that one squadron (Captain Snell)would advance on Lunga Point itself while another(Lieutenant Martin )went to deal directlywith the Japanese , who at some point in time had seized a nearby hill and entrenched themselves there ; after crossing a small stream which flowed between them both, they would then move together towards their objective . The Tetrarchs of 1st Squadron, A Company left about twenty minutes ahead of those from BCompany; as dusk fell upon themboth it became apparentthat enemy forces were closingin for an attack—and indeed when darkness arrived this is exactly what happened.The two squadrons' tanks advanced slowly over rough terrain until they came under firefrom mortars and machine guns located on the surrounding hillsides: this was followed by volleysof artillery

The carved stones seem intended for the same function as those used in present-day Oaxaca , where local rulers are buried under pyramids built around enormous monolith slabs that were once covered wi th stucco and paintings.The material of which these prehispanic monuments were made varies according to their location, but generally they consisted mainly or entirely from basalt, a dark volcanic rock found throughout Mexico' s coastal region between Veracruz (northward along its eastern border) through Tabasco down into Yucatan State near Cancun . The finest examples have been discovered on the Gulf Coast at Izamal ; however many fine ones exist elsewhere in this area including: San Luis Potosi , Zongolaica-Santiago de Queretaro - Guadalajara etc.. These regions all share similar geological conditions favorable for obtaining high quality stone used by prehispanic sculptors.The art of ancient Mesoamerican civilizations was greatly influenced both aesthetically and functionally due to their close contact wi th nature as well being located within tropical rainforests with abundant resources available nearby (such us cocoa beans).

These enormous stone bust carvings stand over four meters tall with facial features finely detailed downto individual hair follicles. The eyes were made of turquoise or jade , mouth & nose usually included but not always; teeth may have been left unfinished so as not t obscure details suchas gums/lips etc . Other features commonly seen include ear spools(typically circular), cheekbones& prominent brow ridge – all hallmarks associated wth contemporary Olmec culture throughout southern Mexico 1896-7 .The first mention in literature about these sculptures was by French ethnographer Frédéric Engelmann (who visited Central America during his expeditions from 1850–52). He observed that the heads had a "peculiar" shape with eyes & nose carved into them, which led him to believe they were representations of deities.

It is therefore probable that at least two artists worked on each colossal head together with numerous helpers who provided support services such us food preparation or the transport of materials between sites where various parts were being manufactured . The Olmecs' use of conical forms may have been inspired in part due to local topography ; given how unevenly distributed natural resources like wood, stone and clay can be found across Central America , it seems likely these factors would also influence other artistic choices made by pre-Columbian cultures throughout Mesoamerica (such as sculpture styles).

> igneous intrusions that supplied much other Olmec construction material.These monumentally scaled sculptures have been called "the first works by artists to be placed outside of caves" because they were positioned upright, outdoors , facing one another across a ceremonial plaza . The faces are divided into four sections: eyes with pupils; mouths showing teeth ; noses; hair styled in distinctive ear lobes or feather headdresses decorated with pendants . In addition there is usually an area below each eye for tattooing and around both ears where jewelry could attach  <unk>  One face has the distinction as being carved from volcanic basalt stone which makes it even more striking.The Colossal Heads have been dated to between approximately  600 BCE -   45 CE , though they may be somewhat older than that date range (see Section "Dating" ). A number of theories regarding their purpose exist, but most scholars agree on one thing: these heads were likely used in some form or another during ritual ceremonies . The iconography found throughout Olmec art suggests an interest in cosmic and supernatural forces ; thus many believe that use by priests would make sense given this evidence  <unk>  Another theory is the presence within each head's eyes could represent spiritual vision through hallucinogenic drugs which have been documented as being widely consumed at La Venta.Colossal Head No.1 was discovered near San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan , Mexico City between May  25th - June   6 th,      CE while Colossi A&Q were excavated from their respective sites around August-October

This is considered to be highly unlikely due to lacking evidence that could substantiate it despite extensive archaeological investigation conducted at La Venta since the early twentieth century, but has become popular among some conspiracy theories , for example in Richard Hoagland's book "The Monuments Of Mars".</div>

In fact there was once speculation that these sculpted figures depicted ancient Olmec gods who controlled rainwater during droughts through their sacrifices .

The only other finds are from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan: four perforated chert sticks and eight pierced shells that may have been handles of some sort (see Table IV).A 1983 study published in Journal de la Société des Américanistes, t.72/50 [4] suggests a date range for this phase between c.20 BC - AD 7 ; while this seems unlikely given its location on Cerro del Mercado , it does suggest an early part of Teotihuacan' s history prior to the city reaching its peak population . The only other example I know is from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan where several burials had their bodies wrapped and then placed into urns or jars with plastered exteriors (see Table IV).This list has been compiled using data provided by STELLA (Stellarium Software) which shows both rising/setting times as well as the azimuth angle for a sunrise event at that time.A group known collectively in Mexico-Teneo studies since 1978 , when Hodder published his seminal work on these figures [5] ; this name was chosen due to its simplicity of pronunciation .

It has been suggested this may have occurred during the first millennium BC or later after European contact began there; however, more recent research suggests these heads were re-erected around AD1050 @.@ A.D./Ce@.@/698 CE . This figure is based on pottery shards found at nearby sites such as Tres Zapotes which date back before 734 BCE (Kulzer & Schiefler).

He wears wigs made out of plant materials such as palm leaves or reeds which are tied around each ear (see fig below).The object is composed mainly from stone, wood and clay; these components were molded together using different techniques including casting processes where molten metal was poured directly onto cast forms before hardening . In addition , some pieces have been carved by hand while others show signs indicating that they may be assembled through methods like soldering joints between parts during construction ; this type of process can create unique designs because there will always exist a certain amount variation among individual units produced under similar conditions due to differences in material properties etc..

It was found together with several other statues at Piazza Armerina by Italian archaeologists during excavations between January - March 1973 led by Giuseppe Fronzuto who worked under Franco De Angelis; these included one statue representing a horse, another depicting what appears like Bacchus riding on it and yet others showing nude male figures performing various activities such as wrestling or hunting game animals .The Colossal Head VII has been placed in an exhibition room dedicated to San Lorenzo located inside Palazzo di Venezia where visitors can appreciate its size compared against life-size mannequins wearing traditional Roman clothing which were also discovered nearby at Piazza Armerina. The head is accompanied with some of the original sculptures found during excavations that had adorned this monument when standing erect centuries ago; these include statues representing Cupid (the goddess Venus' son), Ceres(goddess earth) and Mercury(messenger for gods).This article will explore how art historians have interpreted different aspects about their findings such as iconography ,

> attooing on either side below eye level indicates possible facial scarification.The body shows traces, which may indicate previous repair; a circular incision at one shoulder end is reinforced with what appears as two rectangular patches secured by rivets attached from inside or outside through slits in both pieces of skin (Figure 10). An incomplete line runs down each thigh towards ankle height where it meets another dotted line that extends to just above knee length . Both sets terminate nearer heel than toe , suggesting they were not intended for wearing but rather used elsewhere when the item was still intact – perhaps on display within some building? The lower legs are completely covered and marked out around mid-calf level, while below there’s a dense pattern comprising triangles intersecting at right angles forming diamonds set horizontally.A similar technique is also visible beneath each arm: three lines cross diagonally across chest area before descending towards elbow; these converge with four parallel bands stretched down from opposite shoulders (Figure 12). They continue uninterrupted until just above wrist where two more horizontal rows meet up vertically giving rise to what appears like an infinity symbol . A short line runs along forearm near thumb , which may indicate previous use as some sort of handle or tool – perhaps used in conjunction with the headdress? The back has a large rectangular patch secured by rivets attached through slits cut into both pieces.The piece is decorated throughout, but there are few distinguishing features other than those already mentioned: incised lines appear on chest and thighs; tattooing around eyes gives impression that wearer was older woman (Figure 13).

There may also exist traces from where another set of lips once existed below this one — these two sets could represent male/female dualities . The headdress consists largely on triangular pieces joined together by wires , each piece being pierced at its base for attachment onto the skull via perforations in the headband ; they are made out of stone ( quartzite ? ), shells ( probably cowrie ) , wood (?), gold, feathers & textiles with some small metal ornaments attached to them as well including what appears like miniature jaguar claws or a feline-like mask that has been painted red; it also contains 4 large circular disks which may have served various functions such as covering up one’s face during religious ceremonies .There is no evidence suggesting whether this figure represents an actual person who wore these items on his/her body but rather someone who was buried wearing them at death along side other objects associated primarily wih burial rituals ; however there could be indications of having had multiple identities if all the pieces are taken into consideration.

> ractures on its surface are thought due not only from ancient disaster, but also because one side was used as a pillar for an enclosure and another as a support beam.It is speculated that monumental sculpture at La Venta may have been inspired in part to the Olmec colossus carved stone heads which had previously existed in Izapa , Chiapas Mexico around this time period . A similar head has since been found within San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán by archaeologists working under Matthew Stirling; he suggested it might be of ruler K'inich Janaab Pakal I ( who ruled between 615 -702 AD) or possibly his father Yuknoom Tun-Chan Mo 's. Monument One was constructed with a core made from mud and sticks, covered over with layers of plaster for strength before being painted red to give the appearance that its skin is burning upwards towards heaven as if in pain . This theory comes after another statue at La Venta known only locally until recently when researchers discovered more details about this site during their excavation work there since then they have found many other similar statues around Mexico which were used by Olmec people long ago but now lie buried underground awaiting future discovery!### Statue 2 (Monument A) - Jade Masked Head. The first head was unearthed on March 30,1947 and it has been named "Statute II". It measures approximately four feet high with a width of two-and one half inches wide

> ervation example.Such monuments may be related to other types such as either standing stones ( menhirs ) or megalithic tombs ; both forms were widespread across Europe at this time, but only few examples survive today. This type was found especially on islands like Malta where they probably originated; similar structures also occur in Sardinia - and Sicily- although their distribution there has been much less studied than that which exists for Ireland or Britain itself.[ citation needed ] The most famous of these are those known from Gavrinis , a small island off Brittany . They have often been interpreted by archaeologists as representing the headless body of an ancient goddess (see Matriarchy ), who is sometimes seen with her hair tied up underneath it to form the headdress [3] but this remains unproven.Megalithic monuments were found throughout Europe, especially on islands such as Malta where they may represent remnants left over after earlier colonization efforts failed due their lacking in resources and manpower; however there's also evidence that suggests some people migrated back into what would become Italy during these times which might explain why many similar structures exist here today too! Some experts believe that Megalitic Monuments had religious significance among certain cultures while others think they served more practical purposes like being used for burial grounds or storage facilities because of how large most examples tend to be compared against normal dwellings at this time period .The Gavrinis dolmen is an impressive megalithic tomb located on the island of Groix, near Quimpercornouaille.

The slabs are supported by a concrete base and have not moved an iota for over sixty five yea rs !The head is made of limestone with holes drilled into both sides allowing wooden pegs or rods (not found) which would then be secured using clay mortar - a technique common at La Venta although less so elsewhere on th e coastal plain as far north as Dzibanche where it was only used in the later periods . It has been suggested that Monument 1 could represent one aspect o f Mayan divinity , possibly depicting either Chac, god of rain; Kukulcan who transformed himself from snake to man ; or even Quetzlcoatl whose body ended up split down its middle and buried under his own volcano. Whatever monument #1 is intended t o symbolise there can be no doubt but what an impressive sculpture this is - a powerful image which would have dominated any settlement for miles around !The next monument on our tour with John Elbertson took us past another set of slabs at the back left corner (now gone) before heading north towards Monument 2 . This was also discovered by Blom in October , 1934 during further excavations here, although it had been noticed earlier when Matthew Stirling first came to La Venta because he felt that its design reminded him very much indeed about something similar seen elsewhere. It has since become known as 'The Shrine' due not only too its location but perhaps more importantly what lies beneath; namely a stucco filled burial chamber containing bones which were believed t o be those belonging to some high ranking Maya nobleman or king

> rowed over large eyes and nose with small nostrils, protruding lips, full chins , prominent ears.The surface texture created on La Venta Monument #2 was achieved using mould making techniques such as carving in high relief or hollow-cast sculpture whereby each side is first made from clay which then solidifies into an elongated shape; this method allows for more detail than can be found elsewhere at any other Olmec site (  ). The monument also features a central upright slab with geometric patterns on its face . It has been suggested by some researchers that the head may have originally had four arms instead of two and one leg rather than three but there are no indications anywhere else to confirm these theories.The statue sits upon another stone structure called "El Altar" ("the altar"), which was built in front of it during restoration work between June–October, 2014 after being hit several times over centuries ago causing significant damage; this is believed due because all previous attempts at repairing any cracks or holes were unsuccessful (Gomez, pgs).

> eground on top instead as an extension backward toward what would be considered traditional representation.Weathering has eroded most detail, but enough remains for identification with certainty: On one side stands La Corona woman; on another, Kukulkan (or Quetzalcoatl), ruler-god to whom she offered herself at birth; behind her appears Cipactonal man who gave himself up after seeing that his two children had been sacrificial victims of their mother's sacrifice. As depicted here by von Däniken and others since then it seems like a scene from some ancient Mesoamerican ritual involving human sacrifice before an altar or pyramid structure surrounded by carved figures representing various gods - including those mentioned above as well other deities whose names are lost in time .The monument was built during the reign of Kukulkan, around 120 BCE , but its exact date is unknown because there were no written records at this point (although later ones suggest about AD ). It measures approximately five meters high with two main sections: one on top where he stands holding his head up against another figure who appears to be sitting down below him; then comes Cipactonal man next door followed closely behind by La Corona woman standing beside her son's tombstone which has been carved into an altar-like structure featuring several statues representing different gods including those mentioned above as well other deities whose names are lost in time .Most historians agree that these sculptures depict important figures from precolumbian times. However, they do not know exactly what happened during this period of history and how it is related today’s world events or culture wars (1). Some believe the stone heads were made before Christ while others think more recent dates apply better because their style looks similar to modern artwork found around Europe at about 20 years ago(3)…or even

Other nearby features include the cists at Penygroes Farm .The head was moved to its present position in June, during a major road scheme involving part-demolition of Llanfihangel Aberbythych Church – as such it stands on private land within easy view from both sides of the main Hereford - Brecon highway (A 438).

The findings were published in "San Lorenzo: A New Look" by RodolfoCastillo et al., which also includes an essay on Leonardo da Vinci’s interest in San Diego 1542, when he made his first drawings there during one trip through what is now known as California . This statue can be found inside Alcatraz Island Historic Site Museum where visitors will get information about its history from guides who are trained professionals with degrees related to art or architecture; they'll tell you how this work came into existence and explain some aspects of it that may not have been obvious at first glance like details such as hair length etcetera!

In spite of this success with smaller schools and against superior athletes on paper ; Butler has not always been successful nationally – losing to Indiana State University twice during Stevens ' tenure (though winning once over them while he coached Marquette). The Bulldogs have also lost five times in 10 tries vs top-25 teams since his arrival at BU, though it should be noted that all those defeats came before November so far away games are obviously tougher than home contests.Stevens' first year as head coach resulted in a record setting season for wins by an NCAA Division I team: the Colts finished 34–2 overall and won their conference championship . They advanced through each round of postseason play undefeated to reach Super Regionals where they fell just short against Baylor University despite having two more days rest after winning three straight elimination matches during regional tournament action (they also lost twice while playing six consecutive days). The following spring , Butler again reached this stage but were eliminated both times with losses at North Carolina State University before falling on neutral ground vs Georgetown College due largely because one player was suspended from competition over academic violations committed prior year – which affected performance significantly throughout entire season.## Early years: 1985–2007Stevens grew up in Washington

But in August of that year America's Vanguard TV3, carrying its small American Telstar satellite for transmission from London across Europe through North Africa into New York via the Atlantic Ocean aboard an Atlas rocket , suffered catastrophe when it exploded only seconds after liftoff." The problem with those early satellites is they didn't have very much mass," said Gerry Griffin (now retired), who worked as NASA spacecraft operations manager at Cape Canaveral during these years and later became deputy director there under Robert Seamans Jr., administrator 1972-85 . "When you launch a large object in orbit—like Sputnik or TIROS I —it has enough gravity to pull itself into stable, circular low Earth trajectory." But the tiny Telstar was just too small for this effect; it could not be placed on an even path around the earth. Instead , its motion would gradually slow down until eventually falling back toward our planet's surface where it burned up upon reentry over Australia (or so NASA thought).The first successful satellite telephone call took place between

This marked his first time ever going above five losses before the final game was played during any given campaign , but it didn’t seem likely he'd finish below half way through either season if things continued like they had been until then : Averaging over nine wins per year from start to end since taking charge in Lawrence eight years prior after stints elsewhere around country .Fans had every reason for optimism moving forward too considering how dominant this team looked most nights regardless who came out on top against them - something that hadn't happened often enough previously despite all their successes along with high expectations set upon arrival at helm last decade still intact today. They would just have one more game left before Christmas break arrived so there was plenty time remaining yet where anything could happen given what lay ahead!

The following day, Brad Stevens accepted an offer from Indiana Pacers general manager Larry Bird and former player Danny Granger's request of becoming their newest assistant coach as well as serving on Jim O’Brien‘s staff during his final games in Indianapolis before retirement (which included a playoff series with LeBron James) after being hired by Butler Athletic Director Barry Collier two weeks prior; replacing current VCU Head Coach Anthony Grant who left for Alabama Crimson Tide coaching position .On May 25th , the 18 year old freshman point guard Shelvin Mack announced that he would return to school next season rather than enter into either this years NBA draft or sign up early entry into it. The announcement came just days following Stevens' decision not only keep all five starters from last seasons team but also bring back fellow senior Matt Howard and junior Willie Veasley (who transferred out of Indiana University). On June, Butler basketball program was ranked #9 in America by ESPN Top-Twenty Five poll despite losing four key players on its roster including: second leading scorer Gordon Hayward who declared for early entrance draft; third highest rebounder Andrew Smith whose brother AJ passed away unexpectedly during spring semester while playing professionally oversees as well veteran forward Erik Hawkins whom left school due to family obligationsOn July , Shelvin Mack decided not only return next season at Bulldogs but also play one year after graduating highschool instead .

> second before time expired.This game had many comparisons drawn between it & last year’s championship matchup ; notably Duke being favored over an underdog team from Indiana ( butler) which played similar style of basketball as well : one that emphasized ball control on both ends of floor, good shooting percentage through spacing out players throughout court without running any complex sets or plays for most part during the season + playing strong defense by forcing turnovers / preventing opponents to get open looks at basket . While these two teams were different in terms who they recruited into their rosters and coaching styles , there was still some common ground shared among them – especially when looking back upon how closely matched up those games ended.While neither side could pull away early-on due largely because Duke had trouble finding rhythm offensively while Butler struggled defending against zone ( which forced them often times shoot from outside ), things began picking up steam midway through first half where both sides started hitting shots more consistently leading eventually lead each team taking 37 point advantage going into break: A perfect example came around seven minutes remaining before halftime as Kyle Singler drove hard inside basket & finished layup + drew foul; then shortly afterwards added another bucket by connecting long three pointer over top defense’s head—a sequence that showed how strong he was playing at time despite facing tougher matchups throughout tournament run thus far.After resumption play continued in same fashion until approximately ten minute mark when Duke suddenly found themselves down double digits thanks largely because Bulldogs had opened up big early on using quick transition offense combined with effective shooting from outside (particularly behind arc).

After losing three consecutive games late last season against Villanova , Xavierand Creighton ; rumors began circulating about whether he would remain loyal after all these years spent building up this program into what has become known today nationwide including appearing twice consecutively during NCAA tournament playoffs where they made history becoming just one shy away from reaching their first ever Final Four appearance before falling short due mainly because of poor free throw shooting efforts thus ending any hopes for them making it far enough ahead towards achieving that dream goal - something not many other teams have been able to accomplish recently let alone being considered among best ones out there right now .   However despite losing those three games late last season; but still managing 27 victories overall which was good enough place him at #1 spot within Big East conference standings ; all signs point toward another successful campaign next year under his watchful eye along with help coming in form incoming recruits such as Kellen Dunham who committed verbally earlier this month after receiving overwhelming interest from various schools across country including Duke University , North Carolina State and even UCLA itself!Butler Bulldogs men's basketball head coach Brandon Stevens (born November 30, ______ ) is an American college basketball player

> ushing out onto court, nor is there ever any sign from him when things are going well.Another common trait among successful basketball players — one they learn through experience rather than instruction—is their ability to stay composed under pressure ; it ' s an essential skill that allows them play at peak performance levels even in tense situations where others might lose focus or make mistakes due lacking concentration & discipline towards achieving desired outcome (such as winning). This mental fortitude enables these athletes remain focused during difficult moments while still maintaining composure so they can think clearly without being distracted; something which often separates winners versus losers on game day! The same principle applies off court too: learning how deal with adversity is key part becoming great player who knows what he wants achieve both personally professionally life .Finally , another trait shared by many successful basketball players – regardless if male female young old veteran rookie–is their ability take criticism constructively ; knowing when give yourself praise instead criticizing self unnecessarily helps avoid feeling down about mistakes made earlier games / matches etc.. Instead recognising positive aspects performance allows keep motivated strive harder next time round rather dwell negatively over things gone wrong previously ! This mindset ensures they always stay focused even after losing tough game where could 've won but didn't due poor decisions taken during match itself; something which separates champions from average athletes ultimately helping make them better versions themselves each passing day!It is clear that successful basketball players share a number of common traits. From having strong work ethic and being able to handle pressure, these individuals have honed their skills through practice and dedication in order achieve greatness on the court . It’s also important for aspiring ballers looking up at professional stars or watching games online not only admire what other people can do—but more so strive towards becoming someone who will inspires others

But this time around is not only different because it's another one-anddone situation — meaning players like Kevin Knox can be better prepared when next season comes along if he doesn’t make an impact right away—but also because most teams have more than enough talent on hand already without adding any major pieces via trade or free agency .The Knicks are 10th out west as well behind the Lakers (who just lost Julius Randle) , Clippers(who don't need to do anything else), Nuggets & Timberwolves; all those guys will still get their shots despite losing games against each other during regular seasons due mainly cause there aren't many good ones left over after these four finished first place last year so they can only hope someone gets lucky/good enough later down road when everyone starts having fun again instead being serious about winning championship rings...

Two additional smaller formations intrude into one quarter section of ESA 's MERBOT image (near upper right corner).The interior floor shows two distinct terrains separated by ridges which divide Shackleton into three regions: 1) Around halfway between center point and eastern wall lies a low plateau with more than thirty craters of various sizes; 2) At least four major rilles cross from northeast @-@ southwest through central part . These may be the result o f material flowing across surface during some period when it was ice covered ; or perhaps these are older impact features that were filled in later. The only other geological feature visible is an elongated depression located just north side rim , possibly another ancient impact site (not shown here).

> several sources. Using a model based on sunlight intensity, whereby an impact excavating material to be greater than or equal to half its diameter causes complete shading during every orbital period, gives an estimate that approximately one quarter (24 %) percent - about double what would have been expected by simple geometric considerations alone – are permanently covered with regolith-shaded areas and approximately three quarters uncovered at any given time [3] .The ancient floor is extremely smooth and flat , except for small pits near crater rims  which do not exceed the height of less than 150 m. The lack of large central peaks has led some authors who believed in a lower formation age assigned it the name "South Pole" but this was later abandoned because its low relief does not correspond to an older lunar surface as suggested by that term, although recent studies indicate Saussure A may be older than previously thought (see below). In addition, no evidence suggests there ever existed such features on either side at any period during geologic history .The floor is covered with many tiny circular depressions , about one third smaller and shallower then craters caused from meteoroid impacts  which are located throughout most areas except for near rims where they tend toward higher densities. This type of feature has been attributed to volcanism or the resultant collapse after lava flows [4] but could also have resulted from erosion processes associated with fluid filled void spaces in regolith materials or even by crystallization within silicate melts that had migrated upward through a large network system formed over time under gravity driven forces . In any case, their presence suggests some form of tectonic activity occurred here at least once during its history , perhaps due to

The character Lester Burnham is loosely based on her first husband (who committed suicide), though they never lived together ; her second marriage would inspire Jane's relationship with Ricky . Ball intended American Beauty as a dark comedy and wrote it in a black satirical style , drawing comparisons between the characters of Kevin Spacey ' s Frank Fitts Jr.  and Harvey Keitel ' s Max Cherry for their similarities; she was inspired by watching two men fight at Los Angeles International Airport during which one tried, unsuccessfully to stab another man using his own epi-pen penicillin injector device while screaming "I am an AIDS victim!" The film is named after Lester Burnham singing the song that gives its title (also called ) on album .Ball decided not to pursue her play because it seemed too dark ; instead, in late April or early May 1998 , director Sam Mendes contacted Ball about adapting American Beauty into a screenplay. He had seen and enjoyed three of their previous collaborations: Cabaret (102), Company C ("Company" – 36)and Requiem for a Dream () , but he was most impressed with American Beauty's "sober darkness".

He has such an odd sense about him – like he can be really bizarre and then turn around into this very intelligent person . So you never know what ' s going to come out of his mouth next " . For the role , Spacey stayed up for three nights straight because Mendes wanted a realistic look at Lester's insomniac behavior ; after losing 20 pounds, dropping over $150 in phone calls as well as rent money on video games (to which he was addicted), and gaining six gray hair from stress-related alopecia , Spacey lost nearly all interest when filmmakers told him they would not use prosthetic makeup or wigs to cover it.Benning also thought that she could have played Jane opposite Williams but ultimately agreed with her husband ' s choice of actress . She described the role : " I play this incredibly beautiful woman who has been married for a long time – we don't know how many years yet ...

The movie follows the lives and loves between two women: Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), who arrives from Arizona after receiving a mysterious phone call telling her to come home; Rita Flynn/Diane Selwyn(Laura Harring). They both get involved with different men during their stay at Los Angeles hotel . But soon they find out that things aren’t as easy or safe behind closed doors…

> hat he was making a romance when writing, but that once shooting began he realized there were other themes to be explored. He says :   _" I didn't know what kind_ [of movie] we had until after we shot 50% ... By then you start figuring out where this thing can go."Themes have included adultery and betrayal; conformity versus individualism ; acceptability vs. rebellion ( especially among teenagers ) ; greed as an alternative pathway for success in life rather than talent or hard work . Some critics focus on the theme of alienation from one 's family , which is a recurring motif throughout the film, particularly with regard to Lester Burnham who feels he has been abandoned by his wife Carolyn and neglected by both their children Ricky Jr., Jane _and_ Chris  when they become more interested in each other's activities insteadof having quality time together as parents/children should do according t o them; this feeling intensifies after Lester learns that she had once considered getting pregnant again so that her husband could leave home without any trouble (but ultimately decides against it). The idea behind "aloneness" within families can be seen most clearly during one scene where Jake (Lindsay Duncan) talks about how much better off everyone would have been if only someone like herself existed: "[W]e wouldn 't need anybody else because there _wouldn_ exist anyone who wasn’t exactly what they wanted."= 1.

> into an unrealistic version of what such films are supposed to do, which then places itself in danger from the start."In 1972, Lester Bangs wrote for Rolling Stone magazine: "'American Beauty' can never make you laugh or cry; at best its music can give your heartstrings some gentle tugs now and again while it provides fodder for those who seek out a constant source of misery. It may have taken some time but [the band] finally figured how to turn their own self-loathing attitude against them ... [Its sound is ] like someone trying desperately not only too be creative ,but also simply TO BE ." In his review published in The Village Voice (August 30) the same year, Robert Christgau said that " 'American Beauty,' with all its rough edges, still sounds more coherent than anything else from this bunch."The song's title and lyrics refer to an American beauty pageant held annually at Miss America since September 8th. Accordingly it has become a custom for contestants who win or place in their categories of competition are crowned as "Miss [State] America," rather then being named after any particular state they live within; thus furthering the misconception about how one becomes eligible to compete as a representative of her home-state during these events.Title: “American Beauties” Artist(s): The Beach Boys Album: Surfin’ Safari Year Released (Year Record Label Originally Issued): October,1962 Category : Rock Genre Type Rating Number Track Listings Disc One 03 - South Bay Surfer - Side B 05 – Donna/Do You Wanna Dance?

> fragments into an articulate whole." The obvious candidates are Joel, Mike, Mandy (or Buzz)—but none do so. But we can say this: That for Boylan it was not only a book but also something like his own autobiography , and he wrote both as if they were novels in which everything happened to him personally.Lester Ballard 's story begins when he returns from World War II; Joe' s ends after Vietnam . Loner Danny Deever is executed by firing squad ; Ricky dies on an operating table at age 28 — but then lives until old age with the woman who loves him best of all : her daughter Wanda June, whom she hates more than anything else because "she takes up too much room." Each character has its story within another: Joel is told about by Mike and Mandy (or Buzz), whose stories are also narrated as they occur , not retrospectively. The only one Boylan seems to have been able somehow to know was Willie Stark from _All the King 's Men_ .Boylan' s statement that his book tells a single story over several generations sounds like an excuse for explaining why he does what some critics call the wrong thing with it — writing each of these three tales in different forms, styles, tones; using first-person or third ; employing dialogue heavily sometimes but sparingly at others—all this while making little effort (if any) toward creating unity among them all except through their common characters and situations . In fact , however much we might want there were such unifying threads as those Boyle himself describes here: "The novel is about love between two men who have nothing else"Boylan's book is a masterpiece.

> ross The Universe also illustrates this issue. 10The creator-centric approach has been widely criticized as an outdated methodology, which is why a growing number of scholars now emphasize how collaboration and improvisation play key roles throughout filmmaking processes (see e g Bordwell & Thompson ). In these studies, Mendes' contribution remains significant but its relevance varies from one scholarship tradition to another. For instance in his book on Steven Spielberg 's Schindler s List , Phillip Kaufman suggests that Mendes was more than just the director for American Beauty . He describes him as "the driving force behind it" who contributed significantly during script development stages :Mendes had been working with Ball since 1984 when he cast her for The Kids Are All Right [... ] They were a good team and got along well together [...] During the first three weeks of shooting they wrote their own scenes (with help) at night after work, staying up late into Friday mornings [...] Mick would bring pages to set. We'd read them in our trailers before we went on camera each day , and that way if there was any problem or question about what I wanted from an actor, we could deal directly with him rather than go through his assistant producer .He goes further by claiming "Mendes had been responsible throughout the film-making process" for American Beauty 's success : 12As a result he [Mendes] took total control over every aspect of production -- including costumes and makeup - which left no room for anyone else at all except the actors themselves who were dependent upon Mick s direction alone to carry out their individual roles. The final product is indeed beautifully shot but lacks real depth because it doesn't have any substance underneath its glossiness: there are

> g how he has been reduced to nothing more than an automaton" (Vickery, p.17). He then becomes consumed with fantasies that serve both as escapes for him into another world entirely or provide distraction in the present one: The most common dream involves seeing Jane Burnham at school again ; this serves not only a sexual function but also shows her being popular among peers while no longer attractive enough even for Lester 's attention. This contrasting image of idealized youth and adulthood leaves behind any hopeof escape from prison . In addition , some critics have seen these fantasy scenes as representing repressed desires—for example : " the menace lurking beneath suburban America" (Vickery, p.17) —which are brought to light when he begins having sex with Angela in their garage after work one night despite knowing she is married; they both find comfort here because it allows them each freedom not available elsewhere within society's rules at that time period: He gets away without anyone finding out about his affair while still living under social norms regarding marital fidelity ; She feels safe enough doing what would normally be considered taboo behavior since no harm will come from being caught .The film ends on an ambiguous note : Lester has been released from prison , but we do 	not know if this was due only temporarily or permanently . Some critics believe he may have found true happiness with Jane, who represents everything good and pure in the world—and even more so after she rescues him by killing her father (whom both parents agreed to keep secret) when they were young adults working together at a nearby amusement park; others feel that their relationship is simply one of convenience given how much time passed between them before reuniting again.

He is forced out again when Angela tells him she can no longer see him because her parents disapprove; their relationship ends, although they remain friends with benefits in the following years: Angela eventually marries another man who cheats upon her several times during marriage while also having sex outside it, leaving them divorced within ten months ; meanwhile l e s t er m o ves to Oklahoma City , a city chosen for its distance from any place he was formerly happy and where his former wife lived (and whom Lester still loves).The film concludes as Joey shows up at Big Kmart looking for work after being released on parole . During this time period some of Joeys' fellow workers have been killed by him offscreen —as happened earlier when one killer committed murders without showing what actually occurred— but now with all four dead bodies found inside store walls that same day. The scene ends abruptly before revealing how many people were murdered because no other character witnessing it asks about them or makes mention regarding their absence during conversation later in dialogue within the movie itself , though viewers are left wondering whether any survived unscathed since nothing is shown except these corpses lying there still despite being discovered so quickly afterwards

The novel begins by introducing both characters individually : Lester at home before work (" He was all right for a while ; but then there would come those moments ... when he felt suddenly out-of-step , off balance, disoriented " ) and later after his first encounter with Angela; we are told about her childhood difficulties growing up without parents (she had to take care of herself) which has caused her to be insecure. We also learn something about each character' s past: how Scot went away on holiday leaving Carolyn alone because she wanted him too much, so that the vacation only served as an excuse not see one another again .The narrative is made more complex by being presented from two viewpoints : Ricky 's voice throughout Chapter 15 until Lester goes home at midnight ; then it shifts back & forth between them - even though they are both speaking into their cell phones during most conversations; this helps develop a sense for readers who may have already known what happened previously or if there was ever any doubt whether anything significant took place. The novel ends with " A Brief History of Things That Didn't Happen" (p243) which explains how Scot came to meet Angela while in Paris on holiday: he met her because she is an artist and saw him buying some artwork from someone else, so when his wife discovered that another

> 109fellow, we hear music reminiscent of an earlier scene in which Walter tells about hearing for th first time after losing it and that memory seems especially poignant now as our hero heads off into another world. In short: Mendes ends American Beauty with beauty : in its final scenes this film becomes both visually beautiful ( through some clever lighting ) and spiritually lovely — something one might have said was impossible from the beginning because this is such a dark comedy. But then even comedies can be moving when they end on right notes , although I'm not sure whether Lester's death would count as " hilarious " . Nevertheless, he has achieved at least partial redemption by becoming someone who learns to love again; so his departure does seem fitting for an ending that puts him back together after being torn apart over many years of living alone while running away rather than confronting himself or anyone else head-on in any way whatsoever. 108The American Beauty screenplay ( Mendes and Waters) contains the following dialogue between Carolyn Burnham ("Lane")and her husband Ricky: CAROLYN : I don 't want you to get all excited about this thing we're going on tonight .

The director described his concept for the picture: “It’s not really so much that it's anti capitalistic ...

They reject mainstream ideas such as consumerism <unk>, conformity , apathy toward politics (whether through cynical complacency or fearful apolitics) *, self-indulgence versus discipline.

A new kind relationship w ith others and oneself emerges from this process. It includes both pleasure in one ' s powerlessness to change another person or situation ; that ability at last makes him happy."Critics have commented on American Beauty ' s connections between beauty contests (especially Miss Teen Dream) and plastic surgery, especially when Ricky's mother is implied to be having her breasts enlarged during his absence; Lester becomes obsessed with " reconstructing" Carolyn as well. Some critics believe these scenes are intended ironically , since the film seems critical of such practices . Others say they demonstrate how superficial appearances can lead people into deception about their own lives: both characters look attractive from a distance but fail in intimacy because neither has any real connection or interest outside themselves ; this may explain why he uses drugs ("he doesn ' t care") while she indulges herself by seeking out new men (with whom, unlike him, there is no lasting relationship).Ricky's character is often cited for his unconventional attitude towards women; it has been argued that his "degradation" at Lester and Carolyn Burnham' s hands was necessary to show the true nature of American beauty culture .

> 2013"(L) et' s say I have cancer. Let me explain :" The piece opens as if in mid-sentence: "...and let us remember that all living creatures are tied together by their genes, which they inherit equally ..." This opening line could be a statement made within an argumentative essay for high school students. It may not sound particularly poetic; however its simplicity and directness make it hard to ignore this point and makes one wonder what ' arguments can lead someone into writing such lines about genealogy? In fact , these words form part of the title poem from Lester Burnham (1952 ) - whose work is also included here . They appear on page 64 where he speaks directly through his character saying : "I was born with no fear or inhibitions...and I had everything going right up until my last breath." This sense that all living things are connected by their genes means we cannot help but consider our own mortality when reading any line written within Anker's poetry.Therefore, let us take a look at what happens next: "... and then there were days filled only with pain..." We see how this opening sentence has set the tone for much of Lester Burnham ' s writing , which often deals closely around death . The title poem itself is based on an event from 1974 whereby Lester drove into traffic while drunk after having been fired from his job as newspaper reporter due to lackluster sales figures (p50). This experience led him down many dark paths including alcoholism before he eventually managed get clean again in order start over fresh - leading directly towards success through self-publishing books about artwork!The second stanza follows: "I had everything going right up until my last breath...and then there were days filled only with pain..."

It's a pretty typical Hollywood story,' but when you start thinking back and look @-@ deeper , there are all kinds of things going down in here … You know, no matter what happens to us we never lose our power. We may not have any money or material possessions left –we might be poorer than dirt—but we always retain that one thing called spirit… The guy who had everything [Colin] has nothing now." In his essay "The Other 1 Percent", director David Lynch praised American Beauty for its themes on the nature of happiness:"How do I find out if my life is happy? It's a question most people don't ask themselves; they assume their lives are fine because things like food and shelter work … But you can say, 'I am comfortable,' but does it mean anything more?"

The first two scenes between them indicate this. In scene 1024 (above), they sit down at a table together after an evening out on their date; in its previous scene we saw her struggling to make small talk with him over dinner while trying to avoid touching or making eye contact too often lest she be perceived as aggressive by the man who clearly finds women threatening and intimidating: "What'd you think of that place?" he asks, looking directly into camera before turning back toward her again when speaking next time around so it seems like there is no need for any response from either one since both know what each other wants without having said anything yet .The film does not have much room left at this point where things are going well between them because Lester has already been rejected twice due…. It also shows how they are able to make up after their disagreements with ease while still being respectful towards each another (e g , scene 1029). This proves once more just why these two people belong together despite all odds against themselves; even though everyone else thinks otherwise based on gender roles alone!

In fact, it can even claim some kind or other authority for such strictures: after all we have seen how far from innocent and pure this couple's relationship really was." He compares that with Wes Anderson’ s The Royal Tenenbaums , where an affair between two characters seems intended as both satire on human nature (because neither is happy) but also celebration because they are so attractive together .He says Lester's infidelity " could easily seem like a triumph over his wife/mother in law; instead it comes across more like the act necessary to re-establishing intimacy within marriage" which he contrasted against other films of similar type such as Unfaithful or Infamous. Hausmann sees Little Children primarily through feminist eyes, saying that while the film offers women new opportunities for power and independence , it still presents them with negative stereotypes about sexlessness (Angela), promiscuity(Kathy)and vindictiveness  He argues this is because they are seen only from male perspective .### Film review aggregation websites' ratings summary scores: Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic & IMDB[25][18]

Angelaand Ricky are characters whose lives revolve around the patriarchalfigures within their family . Although both Ball 's father , Col.Fitt s' character is closely related to Lester Frisk in many ways , thereare also significant differences between them because whileColonel Fit ts represents a repressed homosexual man tryingto hide his true sexuality by marrying an unsatisfying woman,Lester Frisk simply seems like your average loveless husbandwho has no desire for sex or intimacy with his wife whatsoever(Jenkins 69). In addition he treats her badly and often abusesher verbally as well which causes Angela great emotional painand distress (Ball ). It can be argued that both charactersrepresent Ball 's father whose dislike of women caused him tobecome attracted towards men , however it is important torecognize th at there are differences between them becausewhile Col.

> citing an example in which Sam Mendes used two different actors to play Bud Cort's character as a child. As per this theory, both scenes are simultaneously set on August-end (the last day) before September begins (Lester’s birthday).Fitt also noted how much American Beauty drawers upon classical Hollywood themes and ideas: family relations, life transitions such as coming out/coming home from war; social order vs personal freedom etc. Fitt explains : “American beauty is not only about homosexuality but it is ultimately concerned with the whole notion of repressed sexual desire – whether that be hetero or gay.”In fact , most critics have used psychoanalytic terminology to describe characters in relation their own unconscious desires . The film has been interpreted by some analysts (such as Peter Lichtenberg) who argue against this theory saying that there was no evidence for a Freudian reading except what he saw on screen, and other critical theories including Lacan's concept of 'narcissism'.   However others see American Beauties " as an exploration into how we live within our society." <unk>  Fitt also noted : “the film shows us what it is like when you’re gay – but not just about being queer.”Furthermore , the narrative structure can be described in terms similar to those used by James Joyce . The first three scenes are considered parallel episodes (or parables) - the opening scene introduces Jane; next she meets Lester at a bar where they have sex while he is still married ; finally there follows another sexual encounter with him on his birthday.

In addition , another layer of diegesis takes place onscreen when Lester shifts his view fr om t h e gymnasium balcony (where the audience can see him) onto an empty staircase where no one else exists. The use o F slow motion in this sequence also points out that all characters are trapped within their own subjective realities . 15 This self-absorbed and obsessively voyeuristic narrative structure parallels many aspects f rom both Dudley Andrew's work as well a s David Bordwell 's, which we will discuss below: in particular, how these scholars describe "thefantasmatic" and the concept of «secondary diegesis» or what Michael Ondaatje calls »a layered discourse [that] is not necessarily obvious to an audience. ...

In contrasting shots between scenes 127-8 and again here , in both cases Lester is seen pacing upstairs ." The cinematography for Election captures many moments where we see people's faces - but also many instances where we are looking at a character without seeing them. This includes a sequence, one that has been cited frequently throughout this chapter, when Lonny returns home to find his front door kicked down ; he then discovers the body of his brother lying dead outside their house (figure 6 ). " It was shot with no dialogue," DP Robert Yeoman explained: it doesn 't say anything about what they were talking or doing beforehand; there' s just silence and emotion in both actors . That moment is very intense because you don t know exactly how these two characters feel towards each other , so I wanted an ambiguity between anger & hurt feelings - maybe even some resentment on Tyrone 's part for being left behind by everybody else." This particular scene would not have worked at all if we had tried to shoot everything close-up ; instead, the camera stays far away from them while moving slowly backward over time as Lonny walks upstairs with his brother lying dead outside their house (figure 7 ). It creates this sense of dread that' s just kinda hanging there without any dialog

This style allows for a greater focus on physicality than traditional methods would allow while still being able to convey complex emotions such as fear , confusion etc., using only facial expressions . Additionally some scenes employ minimalistic framing choices which emphasize specific elements in order provide insight into characters motives/feelings – sometimes even going so far as isolating them from other people entirely (e..g when Lester walks home alone).Overall, the directing of American Beauty is notable due its innovative approach towards storytelling techniques ; utilizing cinematic devices like close-ups & montage editing combined with effective use lightning effects give viewers an intimate look at everyday life experiences without resorting traditional methods that may otherwise be used within Hollywood productions today. It also stands out for how it manages to explore heavy topics such loneliness , bullying etc., while still being able to maintain humor throughout entire movie – something few films have been capable doing before now days .

During this time he was working with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening for HBO ' s American Experience miniseries Too Big to Fail (2008) as well as developing The Normal Heart (HBO's Emmy-winning adaptation of Larry Kramer’s groundbreaking play), both directed by Mendes . Upon seeing an early draft of his script it became clear that they needed a new title , so Ball called up composer Thomas Newmanwho had just scored the pair ’ s previous collaboration : Wag the Dog. He suggested " Angela ", which came from an earlier version in _American Beauties_. Ball said he was inspired when thinking about what makes people beautiful and decided on a girl named after Lester ' s wife . According to Alan, Sam didn't think much more than that until one day while reading through scripts for American Experience at HBO ; suddenly something clicked: The storyline of two men trying to make sense out their lives is reminiscent [sic] of Death Of A Salesmen (1949) , which Ball knew because his father had performed it as Willy LowmanIn October 2015 Mendes told Empire Magazine : " We were working together in television.

He then pitched American Beauty to DreamWorks executives Susan Downey-Kleinman ("a huge fan") and David Linde who agreed that it was worth developing further. The studio approached Shaye, Lynne, Ordesky at the time when he had not yet been signed by United Talent Agency or sold another script; thus when Huvane told them about this project being "the best thing [he'd] ever read" (and later recalled having seen screenplays written only two years prior), they decided against buying rights for $2 million as Ball wanted in order make an

A source close at hand during filming has described him as having been uncomfortable acting out scenes involving his own character breaking down emotionally; it is reportedly a rare occasion when an actor actually acted against type. The director said: It wasn 't so much that he was playing himself – but rather that you see yourself reflected on screen and can tell what people are thinking about your performance , which is different to most actors who do not have the same awareness .The resulting script reflects Ball’s personal experiences in addition t o those of other characters ; one example being Lester' s alcoholism, based upon Ball' s father : I wanted him [Lester]to be like my dad — charming at first sight ... then becoming abusive "  In addition his own marriage provided inspiration for scenes between Angela (played by Brooke Shield) an actress and her husband Peter . The film also contains elements from a previous project that was never completed: a play about two men who fall out with each other but eventually make up. A further scene , which did not appear inthe final cut is described as the most poignant in terms of its relevance to Billy 's character; it depicts Lester discussing how he would have been willing to give himself over entirely t o his wife if only she had given him more love ; this dialogue led Ball' s friends at the time—including Pete Townshend —to speculate on whether or no th e actor-turned -director intended "a kind of suicide note" .## Cast and characters 1974/2013 version: The film stars John Hurt, Toby Jones , Charlotte Ram

The flashback would have complicated this very simple explanation without adding anything significant about character or plot development; in fact, it might even have been seen as an attempt on Ball’ s part at “explaining away” what had happened to Col. Fitts , which would run counter both to his personality and theme .The sequence remained until 1986 when director Stanley Kubrick felt that the film was too long ; he wanted something deleted from every scene except one — where Bono's presence provided comic relief during another tense moment between Beecher & Co., just before they take off for Korea (in place of a Korean newspaper article read aloud by Colonel Tallmadge)—and cut some of the dialogue so it could be shaved down even further; this version is included on many DVD releases under titles such as “Stanley’ s Cut” or simply "Kubricks Cuts."The original script did not include any references to homosexuality , nor does Ball admit that Col . Fitts was gay until late in his life when he began working with younger writers who felt differently about what constitutes an appropriate topic matter than those at Warner Bros. had earlier assumed would pass muster ; however, there are several lines which might suggest otherwise: In one scene where Beecher berates him for being too nice towards some prisoners (which results ultimately from fear of reprisal if they escape), Colonel Tallmadge tells us “ I'd rather have a man dead by my side then alive against me” while staring directly into the camera; this could be interpreted

The director was surprised at how much of their responses were positive, but ultimately decided that only three scenes needed further work – one involving Carolyn Burnham overhearing her daughter talking about menstruation with friends (she had been reluctant earlier during shooting); another showing Lester's girlfriend trying hard not get him drunk while she sings; a third scene where Gabe gets angry after discovering his son is gay shows he loses control when they are in bed together .Ball then returned home again from Los Angeles , which meant taking additional time off before returning to California for reshoots and sound mixing sessions completed by November 1975. He also edited the film himself using editing equipment borrowed from Universal Studios, completing it within three weeks of its final screenplay version being submitted on December 23rd that year (which would become known as "The Final Cut").

> 10 had at least one complete reset. When filmmakers use improvisation as part of their shooting process they are usually referring onlyto certain scenes or lines within an otherwise scripted production ; however, the term has come into common usage among those who employ actors during live performances (including theatre and stand-up comedy) to describe any kind o f onstage interaction that was unplanned for by either party prior t o rehearsal — even if it is planned in advance . In these cases directors often call " action" before each take so performers know what specific actions will be expected from them , thus allowing some degree 10f spontaneity but also providing structure when needed. The difference between improvisation used as part of a film shoot versus improv used while performing a show may not always b e obvious at first glance; however, there are several key distinctions which separate the two practices:Improv While Filming Improvised scenes usually involve actors playing characters who have never met or interacted with one another prior to shooting their lines together (this differs significantly f rom traditional theatre where cast members typically rehearse and memorize all dialogue beforehand). As such these types o f interactions can be very difficult for both directors 10n actors because they require precise timing , blocking & emotional performance skills that must often be developed over time through trial-and error experimentation during preproduction meetings etc . Another major difference between improv acting while filming vs live performances is th at unlike standup comedy shows which are performed solely by comics without scripts/notes on stage; movie scenes featuring improvisational elements will usually include written material somewhere along the lines so someone other than an actor has contributed ideas about what should happen next (i e scriptwriters ) - something rarely seen in actual real life situations where

Spacey said: “I don ’ t think anyone was really expecting me to play the role very straight down-the -middle because it seemed like a kinda quirky character part ” . In addition , he added that Mendes' approach differed significantly compared with their previous collaborations — " I always thought Kevin did good work but now, suddenly here comes this one which is so much more detailed and considered" [4]American Beauties premiered at Cannes Film Festival on May 3rd before being released across Europe during July / August. The film opened in Italy first ( June ), followed by Spain & France ; Germany saw release later than other territories due partly as there were no English subtitles available initially although these issues have since been resolved.[5][6]. It had its North American debut two months after Italian showing when it was screening theatrically throughout Canada . This meant that some audiences would not get a chance to see what they thought might be their last opportunity until December , so if you missed out then do try catch this gem sometime soon !American Beauties is an independent drama directed and written for his feature-length directorial debut, Kevin Spacey. The film stars Katherine Heigl (Knocked Up), Jessica Alba( Sin City)and Colin Farrell as well!

The original director ' s cut ran fowrty minutes shorter than its eventual theatrical length . Mendes excised several scenes and rearranged others ; these changes are outlined in detail below  :  * Jane's dream sequence with her brother (which originally appeared between Chapter Sixteen "The Dream" and Chapter Seventeen) was dropped from both edits, but can be found as an extra on DVD . This scene is a powerful character piece that gives us insight into Ricky’s feelings towards his mother , who he believes abandoned him to pursue romantic interest elsewhere* A scene where Chuckie throws away Lester ’ s cigarettes so they cannot use them against each other during their trial was excised because it did not seem relevant or necessary for the plot at this point in time. However after filming ended Mendes felt there should still exist some evidence of guilt between these two characters — thus another version o''the same shot appears later when Jane and Ricky are leaving court  (This deleted sequence can be found on DVD) * The original cut contained a number of scenes that were removed from both edits due mainly t' their length .

He also created new dialogue which would be used in scenes not found within "Last Journey". These revisions were done without consultation with either author or publisher.Road to Perdition is a 2003 American crime film directed by Sam Mendes that stars Tom Hanks as hitman Mike Sullivan who tries protect his son despite being hunted himself for betrayal from mafia kingpin Connor Roe (Jude Law). The screenplay was adapted into book format titled Road To perdition: A Novel Based On Original Screenplay By Max Allan Collins & Richard Russo; it's the first work of fiction based on an original script written specifically for cinema release in history according Wikipedia .

'Is there anything you don’t like?' And they always say no." He also said that when a production team decides how much lighting will be used during filming (rather than adjustments made later through editing), then shooting can begin without delay ; because of his experience working both as director-of - photographyand editor , he feels comfortable making such calls . Hall was inspired by the cinematographers Roger Deakins and Christopher Doyle who had worked with Mendes previously; their styles were "very different" but shared an emphasis on creating images which could convey emotions in addition to narrative information. According t o him, it's important not only for audiences but also actors: "[A]ctors love shadows ... They like light too much". In one interview wi th The Hollywood Reporter magazine from February  2013 ; H all said that when directing his own films (including Road To Perdition) he triesto make them look as if they are being filmed by someone else .  Hall chose to use a handheld camera at times during filming so that scenes would be "more intimate" and more involving than those shot using tripod-mounted cameras; this was inspired partly because of the influence on him while growing up watching movies made in Hong Kong. He also used anamorphic lenses instead of spherical ones , which provided greater depth perception for audiences wi th wider screens or televisions   ; H all said :[t]he way you see things through these [anamorpic ]lens is much like how we actually

They wanted it depicted without cars or other modern features, allowing people' s faces full expression; they later decided against this after viewing footage shot during World War II which showed bomb damage, including debris falling onto streets from buildings above ; in retrospect , Hall felt that his original concept was overly idealistic given how much violence takes place within The Bourne Identity filmIn contrast to the more peaceful compositions seen throughout most scenes set on @-@ ground level , many shots up close show chaotic action taking place . These were achieved through techniques such as panning slowly across crowds so individual characters could be identified by their clothing or facial expressions rather than body language alone. This method helped capture realism while also creating suspense since viewers would never know exactly what each person is doing until they see them move into frame; it worked well when combined with handheld cameras which made everything feel even closer and grittier overall."  - The Bourne Identity's aesthetics are rooted in its visual style, featuring scenes of Paris that take on an almost impressionistic quality due to Hall’s use @-@ soft focus lenses . In addition , certain shots feature multiple exposures superimposed over one anotherto create complex imagery not possible without digital technology available at the time. This gives us insight into how ambitious this movie was from both technical standpoints as well artistic ones too!

> 1982 - The first feature length documentary about Martin Scorsese was filmed by Robert De Niro. Few knew it, but this wasn't your typical behindthe scenes look into an artist or director; this movie would come full circle in its own way.The story begins at a film festival where one man is presented as "Martin Scorcese". We see him being interviewed on camera while he discusses his life thus far before we go back to when things were much simpler for Marty: growing up poor (and often hungry) with parents who struggled financially due largely because they didn’t want their son working during school hours so that meant no money coming home either! Then there was also all those other problems like having no friends whatsoever...but I digress… The next part of our journey takes place after this initial introduction has been made; it shows how successful Martin became through hard work and determination despite never receiving any formal training at film schools or universities.This is a story about the making of the documentary, not just its subject matter--it's an inside look into cinema itself as well. It features interviews from people involved in every aspect: directors who worked closely with Marty (including Robert De Niro), actors he casted during his early years when they were unknown commodity(ies) like Harvey Keitel among others...and so on! We even get some insightful commentaries by industry professionals such director Steven Soderbergh himself along w/ other artists whose work has influenced him over time including Francis Ford Coppola & Quentin Tarantino .The movie ends abruptly and leaves you wanting more information about how this man became one of Hollywood's most sought after filmmakers.

> d e l i ght was weakened by a 20 percent gray filter )Rhythm and Slow Motion The two primary ways that slow motion is used are rhythmic repetition — wherein an action or series o f actions, repeated over time, seems somehow different because it has been altered from its normal speed; and contrast . In slow-motion footage we often see an event more clearly than if filmed at regular speeds. This clarity can be explained in terms either of greater detail within each frame itself (" sharpness ") , as well as less blurring across frames ( " smoothness "); thus the optical illusion results not only fr om a subjective sense but also empirically measurable factors .Another use for Slow Motion is to create dramatic tension by emphasizing certain aspects : e g., violence or sexual content — whereby editing decisions are made based on what will look best when played back slowly rather tha n with normal speed . In this way, we're able see exactly how something happens; sometimes even discover details that would have been missed otherwise due solely o r primarily because they were moving too fast f or our brains/eyes could process them properly (e.g , if someone threw an object at another person in real time). It may also be used as a means of accentuating emotions such as surprise and shock—for example: Whenever one character sees blood spill from their wound(s), slow motion footage shows us not only where those cuts are located but just h ow deep inside each individual tissue layer there is still some amount remaining intact after being severed!The use of Slow Motion can lead to other effects when combined with editing techniques like Cross-Cutting or Jump Cuts .

> 4-6, it was released on home video to a respectable audience.American Beauty is about as straight forward as they come but still manages to be highly complex both emotionally & intellectually while being wonderfully original at times. Anchored by an excellent performance from Kevin Spaceys he becomes this character that you just can’t help falling for even though whats going through his head may not make sense or seem right because its so twisted yet also shows how human we are when put into situations where everything else falls apart around us except our own minds ability which leads them down these dark paths filled with regret fear hate and loneliness . The acting here was great all round including Ricky Jay who plays Jim Carreys best friend in the film as well, Heather Graham does a fantastic job playing her role too!Kevin Spacey delivers one of my favorite performances ever. It really is something special to watch him play Lester Burnham; you can feel every emotion he’s feeling through his body language alone – even if they don’t make sense at first glance (and sometimes not until later). There are moments when I want more from this movie than just watching an actor do their thing on screen because there seems like so much potential for exploring deeper themes within its story but alas- it doesn't happen often enough during runtime which leaves me wanting more after seeing how good things could have been had writer/director Sam Mendes taken advantage better with what material was given here .American Beauty is a film that has many layers. It may be hard to see the beauty in some of these characters, and you might find yourself wondering if they deserve any sympathy or understanding at all as viewers who know nothing about your life experience are forced into empathizing

David Denby in New Yorker magazine called Eisenberg an Oscar-worthy actor (although did not mention Spaceys' performance). Mick LaSalle at San Francisco Chronicle , however , was unimpressed by the performances; he wrote that "Jesse Eisennburg and Andrew Garfield are both good actors but they play their roles so stiffly here you want to slap them across the face" .David Edelstein reviewed The Social Network for NPR 's Fresh Air on October 1, saying : "'The film is a triumph of acting.

After receiving permission from Governor John Hancock he traveled through Europe between 1782–95 where he met with leading political figures including Edmund Burke , Joseph Priestley and other prominent thinkers before returning home permanently around 1803 at which point Congress awarded him $4,667 for travel expenses incurred while on this trip abroad .

He also owned lands along Pennsylvania' s Susquehanna River valley ; these included tracts that would ultimately form parts York Township and Lancaster Counties, as well as other areas westward towards Pittsburgh PA. In addition , he acquired landholdings within present-day Maryland - including some plots on which modern day Baltimore City stands today! As a result of all these acquisitions Gore was able to establish himself quite comfortably financially before retiring from politics .Given the various conflicts with his neighbors during this period there are few records left documenting exactly how much money George had made through buying or trading real estate in Virginia alone; however given what we do know about him it seems safe assume that by then end if life's political career (which ended around year 1805) he must have been worth well over $3 million dollars.

He arrived back at his home port , Portsmouth NH , early December 1796 after a voyage lasting thirty days (and including five stormy nights). His wife Rebecca did not make this trip but remained behind with their children, who were now teenagers: son Edward, age fifteen; daughter Elizabeth ("Betty"), eleven years old.Gore's first months back included attending to financial matters related both to estates he owned elsewhere than Waltham—in particular the one near North Yarmouthe in Massachusetts that he inherited from father-in-law Nathaniel Gorham and which was later renamed Gores Hill by him . He also continued his efforts on behalf of Native Americans living among British loyalists , a cause about whose worthiness little could be said publicly during these times when peace between Britain & America remained elusive but many New Englanders were convinced would eventually come (although few, if any at all , had confidence it might happen soon).In 1798 there came an unexpected development: Gore's son Edward joined up with another group called "The Society for the Suppression of Vice" led by Samuel Smith; their mission included going after prostitutes in Boston where they were known as "the Swan Club".

A few days later Calpurnius Piso was tried by Tiberius Claudianus as well; both were found guilty despite having no evidence provided other than what had been said about them from behind closed doors when they left Rome ; it is believed these events may have occurred due because one or more conspirators became afraid that their own lives might end if others knew how serious things really were and thus decided to leave town quickly before any rumors started spreading among those who remained in the city .According to Suetonious , Nero's mother Agrippina ordered him not only kill her husband but also his sister Octavia (the wife of Gaius Caesar). This plan failed however, as she was killed by an assassin on August 19th AD.Suetonius says there are two reasons why people think this happened: firstly; when he came back from Greece after being sent away for killing Galba during civil war between him & Otho over control of Rome which ended with victory going towards Vitellian side leading them into power then soon enough they took down another one called Vespasian who ruled alongside Domitian until both were executed under Titus' reign along w/ their families excepting Flavia Julia Scribonia wife whom lived long life afterwards despite losing all her children (except maybe Marcus).

Nero was praised for not killing any prisoners during this event , but rather exiling those convicted to various locations throughout his empire instead which caused outrage among Romans at tha t time due mainly because many were afraid he would execute people if they did something wrong so it became known as “the first bloodless rebellion” after Caesar’s death when Julius had been killed by Brutus and Cassius .

A Roman army under Corbulo began the invasion of Armenian territory in June , and Nero sent several letters encouragement for his successes along the way including a letter that stated "Corblus is an invincible commander". By September he had established himself at Tigranocerta (modern Diarbekir) where he waited until April to receive reinforcements before resuming operations; after taking Carrhae, which was considered important because it lay on one side of two major trade routes into Mesopotamia.In August or early October there were heavy clashes between Parthians  who outnumbered Roman forces by ten thousand men . In late December/early January , Corbulo's army reached Nisibis and proceeded eastward toward the Euphrates river crossing point near Artaxata ; during this time period several battles occurred against Tigranocerta defenders led by Pacorus II (son-in law to King Vonones I) who had been appointed as general for Armenian affairs shortly after his father died in battle against Rome at Carrhae about two years earlier - it is believed that these skirmishes took place around mid February because according historical sources there were heavy casualties among both sides which included many Roman officers including Gaius Julius

This meant that many small businesses went bankrupt as there was little protection from fraudulent transactions and corruption amongst officials managing these events on behalf of local governments who would benefit financially themselves through extortionate fees charged by them .As the tax rate rose to pay off Nero's extravagant building projects , citizens lost their wealth more quickly than before which led some senators such as Seneca (the Younger) into debt collecting at fairs whereupon they could be accused under law if found guilty even though others had acted similarly without any punishment because all were equal in front judges appointed for each case so there was no protection from prosecution despite innocence being proven time after again.

Though weak in body, his mind had great strength; nor did he lack either courage or magnanimity.” He died at the age of thirty-two on June 9th AUC (73 AD). His death marked a major turning point between Republicans who wanted to restore traditional values versus Imperialists who believed Rome needed new leadership under Caesar Augustus - though there would still be many years before actual transition took place as various factions struggled for power over decades afterward .

Historian Michael Grant claims instead, "the number killed in the fire may have been less than five hundred". This could indicate either a smaller area burned or fewer buildings damaged as opposed too much destruction with few survivors since most homes would not be made out of stone like those belonging wealthy Romans whose houses were spared .## See also 2017 Rome Fire

Modern scholars generally consider them unreliable because they are out-of-character for historians from antiquity; however, Roman sources do state that most persecutions under Rome's emperors began with false accusations of conspiracy against their lives (see also The Twelve Caesars 39:2).It has been claimed in popular culture and more recent scholarship such as Simon Schama ' s Citizens : A Chronicle of the French Revolution , that Nero died while fleeing to his palace on the Palatine Hill after setting fire to parts or all but one district . This is not supported by any ancient source. In fact it was generally known at this time—and even today —that he committed suicide when surrounded; though some sources claim a friend stabbed him, others say that no weapon could be found with which he would have inflicted fatal wounds (see also The Twelve Caesars 39:2).The location where tradition says Suetonius's body fell has been marked as "Neronian Gardens" since medieval times and can still be seen in Rome near via di San Gregorio della Divina Pietà al Celio , but there are many competing sites for the original burial. In recent years it was discovered to lie underneath the church of Santa Maria del Popolo . Nero is believed by some scholars such as Peter Garnsey, a classicist at Cambridge University who specializes on Roman food supply problems during this period; and David Mattingly (professor emeritus) authored The Romans: From Village To Empireto have died from suicide after he heard that his mother Agrippina had been murder ed by her son Domitius Ahenobar

This brought about a long series of wars . In each case Nero was persuaded that there were reasons for intervention apart from territorial expansion such as Roman support for an ally threatened by Parthian aggression ( Edessa ) protection or restoration to power in some form , the guaranteeing independence or even relief aid to Rome ' s vassal kings, and similar arguments . The result is seen as more than one warand all are called "Parthian" wars because they involved both sides fighting on their respective frontiers but this overlooks internal rebellions within kingdoms which may have been encouraged by external powers. At times these campaign resulted in disaster - see Siege of Nisibis ; Battle at Rhandeia – whilst others had mixed results like that against Cappadocia where an initial victory was followed up with a defeat elsewhere leading ultimately to peace treaties being concluded between the two empires , 163–87).The Parthians fought back hard and sometimes, when Roman forces penetrated deep into enemy territory as occurred during the Armenian War (54-62), they were able to force them out .

> Domitian' s library.Certainly there is no reason why we should doubt Tacitus ' version, which in any case seems more likely than Dio Cassius'. The most plausible explanation has been offered by John Rufinus : Nero had promised that those who saved themselves would be allowed a safe retreat into Parthia (a Roman client state) ; but when it became clear how many people were going over from his side and fleeing with Galba , he felt betrayed; hence his reflections on death . It may also have occurred to him at this point for the first time  that suicide was preferable.Towards midday of January  8 th , Tacitus tells us, "Nero' s friends began to arrive in great numbers" _._ Accordingly they entered one after another through secret doors leading downwards : Nymphidius Sabinus arrived last of all accompanied by a few slaves bearing gold candlesticks which had been plundered during an earlier attack upon the house where Cornelius Cinna lay dying (a close friend and alliance-partner). Soon afterwards Galba came into view ; he took his seat on Nero 's throne while those who followed him were seated round about. The senators present did not sit at their usual places but crowded together nearer  Galba .According to Suetonian tradition, as Tacitus puts it in _The Annals_ , "all was done with perfect decorum" : nothing seems out of place here except perhaps that everyone should have behaved so calmly when faced by such a monstrous crime. It is unlikely they could all have been persuaded or forced - even if some had wanted-to take part; certainly many must simply be assumed dead and

The elder two were his daughters Julia Drusilla , whom he named after her mother ; but since she died young (in about AD69) it is not clear whether Nero intended that this should be a permanent name for any future child born from their union." As no son of hers survived the birth or early life stage however - and as both Galba & Otho had been killed in battle during Civil Wars between the Roman Senate  to usurp power following these events- then "Drusillia" was never used again . Suetonius also wrote : "...he made use of every expedient, even incest. He committed adultery with his sister Octavia , whose husband he murdered ...". This may have given rise to modern myths about incestuous relationships within Nero's family but it is more likely that this refers only obliquely (via a third party) since there were no known children from such an union and as Octavilla died before Agrippina - meaning she could not be the mother or grandmother of any child born after her death- then none would ever exist either way despite rumours otherwise . Finally Suetonius also wrote : "The emperor frequently showed himself in public disguised like one of us; once even appearing at nightfall wearing nothing save his shoes , with short curly hair, eyebrows plucked out ..."

In its strictest sense it means "the study of historiography" (that branch concerned with studying how people write about their own culture). But because this can be difficult and time-consuming, many scholars instead use more general terms such as 'historical analysis' when discussing specific topics like slavery . This article examines both sides: whether Nero was indeed real; what he did during his reign - including warfare against other rulers who challenged him for power over Rome itself!Nero has been described by some modern commentators to have had a legendary status rather than historicity , since much is known only through ancient sources which may not always reflect actual events accurately enough so that we cannot tell if they were true or false. The fact also remains however that there are few facts about this period of history at all because most records from the time (especially those written in Greek) do

In a sermon on Romans in A.D  197, Tertullian refers to Roman authorities who had been involved with suppressing Christians during earlier periods but makes no mention or reference to any such involvement before 64 AD ( which is when Nero began his persecution )### Early Christian writers' accounts: Josephus & The Talmud 30-52 CE—Pilate vs Herod Antipater the Great as perpetrator of Jesus death? . Pilates role minimized through time? False trial and execution alleged by early church fathers ? . "Jews" were an ethnic group in Judea , not a religious one. Jews believed in One God, Yahweh/Elohim; most Christians do too today..Christian tradition views these events with reference to two major characters : (1) Pontius Pilatus who was governor over Roman Judaea from AD  26 –74 ; he is described both negatively & positively: The Gospels state that some scribes are accusing Christ [ Luke 23 vv9-10 ] of heresy — for saying He Himself IS the Son Of Man . This charge is later echoed by Jewish leaders before Pilate’s court , according to Josephus and Talmud. But it seems this incident may have been a set up, as John points out in his gospel when they sought Barabbas instead—who had committed murder..Pilates wife has him questioning Jesus on whether or not "this man" be released ..[Matthew ch

> pochraphon says : 'Clement, who was appointed bishop in Rome ( ibid., p148 )' - but it appears he may have been one or more bishops over many years as this text also states: ‘their [Peter & Paul] successors were succeeded ...’ . It seems likely they both died within months , possibly even days apart and their tombs are close together at Vatican Hill – although there has never yet been found any remains of either Peter or Paul which can be positively identified with them – if indeed the tradition is correct that these two men actually existed. The earliest reference to a leader called Clement being executed by Nero comes from Tertullian ( c 205 A.D ) in his work " De Corona" :‘For we must not suppose it was on account of a crime, but because he [Peter] had suffered for Christ's sake; so also did all who confessed Him as Lord , even unto death ...’ .  He may have thought this execution took place under Domitian and thus make an error regarding dates or use hyperbole - which could be interpreted either way – since the time period between Peter & Paul is roughly thirty years if one accepts that they died at about the same age ; hence Tertullion would be writing some sixty to seventy five years after their alleged martyrdom. But there are no other references in literature outside of Christian texts from around late third century onwards, indicating any knowledge by pagan writers during Nero's reign nor earlier than c AD160-25 , when Irenaeus writes : ‘For it was through this man [Peter] and his companion Andrew who preached with him

Rather than a deliberate attempt by authorities specifically targeting Christians as a class it would have been more likely simply another one among many Roman execution methods carried out without regard for those actually responsible ; Eusebius describes Christianity having only recently come into existence when Jesus died ( cf . Gospel harmony ) and therefore presumably still new enough in Rome to be regarded with suspicion .Christian tradition states that the Apostles Peter and Paul fled from Jerusalem after Emperor Nero 's persecution of 64 AD , which was said to follow an uprising led by Jews against Romans, including several fires around the city.

In this view, they died under Claudius' rule while serving their sentence for inciting insurrection against an emperor who had no connection whatsoever with Palestine: hence Agrippa I instead being identified in the storyline as "the king" whom Peter challenged before his execution ( Acts ).

> Apocalypse foretold. He also noted another Christian who took passages in Revelation literally, believing there were two beasts and a false prophet involved with them. The following year Tertullian asserted "that when we hear 'the Beast' spoken off by any one else than John himself (in his book on Patmos), it is an error."### 5th century to modern times: Catholics and Protestants divide over interpretation of prophecy from Paul's letter to Thessalonians about final events before Second Coming or Parousia , which they both accept as referring primarily if not exclusively the arrival Antichrist . During this period Biblically-literate Christians began interpreting apocalyptic literature in a more symbolic manner. Theologians such as Augustine of Hippo, Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagita and Gregory I saw these visions having allegorical meanings that could be interpreted by anyone regardless their education level; whereas others like Jerome used them only for educated people who understood Greek (the language original texts were written) and Latin translations of New Testament books (which he translated).In 1957 , Pope Pius XII published an encyclical letter entitled Mystici Corporis Christi on the nature mystics . This document emphasized the unity between Jesus' humanity with his divinity in order to achieve salvation through faith without works. The pope further stated: "If a man wishes not merely listen but learn from these words, then it is necessary that there be some knowledge of history." He also wrote about how Apocalyptic literature could be interpreted allegorically; while other Biblically-literate Catholics like St Augustine and Pseudo Dionys

Jussieu in 1789 from specimens collected during Captain Cook's third voyage , though it had been known since about 20 years before then through collections made on HMS Endeavour under Joseph Banks ; Glassman (who did not cite either of these publications ) argued that the name Spathiphyllum should be used instead because this included all species except one - S . callosum which he considered to belong within another new subgenus called "Spathyphylla" based upon morphological differences between its inflorescences and those found elsewhere across genus members including A. <unk> . He also created two additional genera for other plant groups : Neo-spathe , encompassing what are now known as Dendrochilium + Chlorophytums or possibly Leucorhiza ; while Orthospathiphyllon covered such plants like Miconia plus most others from tropical America ( but not any parts of Asia ).The type species is Sathornia callosa, which was originally described by Johan Peter Forsskål in 1782 under the name Caladium ovatum before being placed within genus Spathiphyll

> ﬁ cult for collectors, so even when they occur together with other palm genera (as often happens), there may be no record available. If one assumes that each individual plant represents an independent population then this is equivalent to assuming either single or multiple origins ; but if several individuals can represent a localised fragment from which new plants could arise via vegetative reproduction - as appears likely given their morphological similarity – it means assigning more value than before to unidentiﬁ ed populations within known taxonomic entities [28–30].It seems unlikely that these two interpretations are mutually exclusive , and Henderson was aware of the difﬂ culties . In his 1975 paper he wrote : “The recognition of species in palms has become increasingly complex. Many doubtful cases remain, even among those who have devoted much time to this problem.” However by assuming some level at least between single origin and multiple origins for each <unk> population (as is now done), there can be no certainty as regards their status with respect to one another or any other populations from which they may derive – except perhaps when closely related speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed taxa are concerned [28–30].A second issue concerns the use of molecular data .

Sparse or incomplete col- lections make identifying species even more challenging as well 😁

This company ceased all operations by December due to financial difficulties brought about primarily through poorly chosen releases during this period; however several months later another entity named "The Thanhousers" started making films.The filming location used by the Thanhouser Company appears not have been located and it's unclear if there was a set built on site or any other type of scenic backdrop for use in shooting exterior scenes, but what is clear that most likely much more time would be required than one day alone with many people involved both behind-and-in front of camera (staff members who worked on sets), plus actors/actresses themselves who had to memorize lines while also getting into character before each shot took place - all these things make me think this process might take several weeks at least!  When we compare how long ago production began versus nowadays when everything moves so fast thanks technology advances like cell phones etc., I feel confident saying our ancestors probably didn't have such luxuries back then either; instead relying upon written notes rather telephone calls or emails as means communication between those working together towards common goal :)

At that time most Protestants living on both sides, but particularly Catholics supported this division between Unionism/Loyalist (which at least nominally included all protestant political parties) , nationalists /republicans which did not apply to non-nationalist catholic voter s . The reason for this was simple ; in the eyes of those involved it seemed reasonable that unionists should be represented politically by their own party and equally a Catholic politician could represent them if they so chose rather than being forced into supporting republican parties like Fianna Fail or Fine Gael who had been established before partition and were viewed as dominated by Protestants. This view has become more complex since then, but remains common among Catholics from Nationalism/Republican backgrounds (but rarely Unionist )The conflict is often referred to simply as "the Troubles" which while not an entirely accurate description does reflect the fact there have never really b een two sides in this conflict ; even when the Provisional IRA was at its height , it did no t control much of Northern Ireland . The British Army certainly controlled all major roads & towns except Belfast City Centre itself where they had little influence despite being stationed in and around Royal Avenue; most sectarian murders were carried out by individuals or small groups who received their orders via a network o f contacts that reached far beyond what would normally be described as paramilitary organisations. This is why describing those involved simply "Protestants" / Catholics/ Nationalists etc misses part if not all of the story, so does saying just "Loyalist Parades".

The author has also written several other books on different aspects related either directly through personal experience as well indirectly via research done elsewhere e g Some were born in England but grew up here too! Roberts spent much time living among Loyalists after being arrested himself , including working closely alongside them during some particularly difficult periods within that community when things got out-of control resulting from governmental policies aimed at suppressing dissent by force rather than dialogue with these groups which could lead towards resolving problems peacefully instead .In the end, “A History of Derry” is a must read for anyone interested not only about Northern Ireland’s past history and present day politics but also on how we can all learn something valuable today through understanding what happened there yesterday – whether they be British citizens who have lived their entire lives abroad or Irish nationalist descendants returning home seeking answers after decades apart due to exile status imposed upon them during earlier times. With this book in hand you will gain insight into why people react as strongly against perceived oppression even if it seems impossible at first glance because things haven't changed much over time; instead look deeper beneath surface level changes like technology advancements made possible by modernity while still maintaining traditional values passed down from generations before us so that future ones might inherit knowledge worth preserving too!The "A History of Derry" is an excellent resource for anyone who wants a better understanding about the city and its history.

In November , after several weeks fighting on both sides for control between British Army soldiers and paramilitaries involved within Nationalist community; this led up towards Christmas Day holiday season where peaceful protests occurred outside Bogside Community Centre before shots fired into crowd killing one person dead while injuring many othersThe city's name is derived from the Irish Doire meaning "oak wood" or perhaps even earlier, Daire Calgaich which means Oak Wood. This was recorded as early as AD605 when St Columba visited Derry to preach Christian

So far ive gotten allot outta NI as well. Its good when you go back home especially if its just once in while or even better still spending Christmas with your family which most people dont get to do every day of their lives nowadays . The best thing that could happen would be to make it so we can travel around freely without being stopped at checkpoints and interrogated, although there are many areas where nationalists/republicans live they arent allowed into unionist controlled towns like lisburn , bangor etc. and vice versa...its sad really but thats the way things have been for over 30 years..and probably will continue until all sides learn how much pain this causes us both.I lived in Northern Ireland from birth till I was sixteen when my parents moved away due mainly because of work issues (my father worked as a joiner). My main memories during that time were: - Schools where you had to walk through Nationalist or Unionistic districts separately, depending on which school your attending- Police Checkpoints at every junction leading out of Belfast into unionistic areas like Bangor/Castlewellan etc.- People being shot by security forces and paramilitaries outside their homes while sitting with the family after coming home for dinner...Born 1964 grew up there till i left in 82. The war was still going then but not so bad yet. I remember watching all those people walking down the road towards Dublin as they fled from Derry & Donegal because it got too much to take anymore .The Bloody Sunday massacre, seeing my parents crying on TV

This event prompted mass civil disorder in Derry, known collectively throughout Ireland as Bloody Sunday .

In addition he claimed: The RUC were never interested i n policing ; they spent their whole careers doing nothing more than ensuring politicians got out of trouble ( p.18 ) This is probably true, although it does beg questions about how many officers knew what really went on behind closed doors at Stormont or Castlederg Police Station - not to mention other places .

On March 21st 1968 after almost four months since its establishment Free Derry came into existence with a crowd estimated as high as fifty thousand gathering for ceremonies in Ebrington Square which marked what became known locally " The Day Of Days ".The events that followed were celebrated throughout Ireland , Britain and across Europe where thousands gathered outside Londonderry Town Hall . On April Fools day of this year it was announced from Downing Street by Harold Wilson the Prime Minister that all barricades would be removed within twenty-four hours — there was no resistance to his order, except among some paramilitary groups who had earlier made similar threats against British forces. However, many people saw little benefit in disarmament because they felt safe behind their makeshift defences anyway; moreover most Irish republicans did not wish for peace with England at any cost as long as Northern Ireland remained part Of Great Britian### The People's Democracy and Civil Rights Association (1968–70)

This was done so he wouldn’t have anything else distract him or disturb what she says next which could be interpreted differently depending who sees this image=-=-=-=

The lyrical content was also discussed by reviewers who found meaningful messages within Come What ( ever ) May . Reviewer Bryan Reesman of AllMusic said " ... the group has grown as songwriters [and] these songs aren't just tunes with cool guitar riffs but each is chock-full of emotional truths." However , some critics were less impressed with this change in writing style, such as Melchor from 411mania saying that despite there being a lot more depth to them than many other bands they are still " not quite at an elite level where you can take everything away and it would be fine without vocals or lyrics."

According to Eric Darton, author in his book, Cruising Utopia:The Then & There Future of Queer Culture (New York : Henry Holt), Columbia Pictures filed suit against the magazine after their lawyers claimed that Steinberg's image had been stolen by a studio employee who watched television coverage of the World Trade Center being built and then drew out plans for The Towering Inferno .In fact , Columbia Studios officials stated they were unaware that one existed until contacted about its similarity; however , many thought otherwise because some people have speculated there might be an inside connection between those two events.  20th Century Fox sues New York Magazine over 'Towering infernos'.

This essay will analyze this poster created by cartoonist Saul Steingrad which shows how America sees other countries from an American' s perspective.. In my opinion I think that he had a good idea to show the world as seen through american eyes because it is true you can learn alot of new stuff just listening to someone else talk who has experienced life first hand instead of hearing something from another person secondhand like most Americans do today with international news media and foreign travelers coming into our country every day, but what if we could see everything in one glance? Well now thanks To Mr Steinberg We Can!.

Russia occupies almost four times as much space on this map than it actually does - an interesting choice considering that at least in Steinberg' s time Russians were not considered very smart by Western standards : one could see them as "the dumb giant" or even a caricature version thereof (compare with Man Ray 's Russian dancer ).The Hudson River and Manhattan have been altered to make room for 10th Avenue . The river is wider , the island of Manhattan has moved southward so Tenth Ave crosses over both rivers, and all land between the two Rivers north from Chelsea Piers through midtown down into Soho on west side up until Hell Gate Bridge east of Roosevelt Island are missing. Steinberg also gave it its own peculiar shape - in reality New York City' s grid system extends far beyond Mid-Manhattam, but only a small part can be seen here : there were several attempts by various city planners during this period (and after) to expand Manhattan 's "grid" further .Steinberg clearly intended his map as an exaggeration , rather than making any sort attempt at realism ; he admitted that the illustrations was made without regard for accuracy or detail and even stated explicitly:I hope you don’ t take my cartoon too seriously… It is not meant to be accurate. I have drawn it simply with reference in mind of how things look from above when one takes off into space.

> posed isolation and insularity, but at least recognizing them as such (while not quite grasped) is humorous for being so accurate.  While acknowledging it may have been offensive to some viewers , Fulford suggested "the viewer who felt threatened by these images had no business there" because they were painted on boardwalk cafes where people would be more likely than elsewhere in Manhattan to expect such artistic expression . He also argued that this kind of work was important historically because many postwar Canadian artists like Riopelle sought inspiration from the European avant garde without fully embracing its values or aesthetic sensibilities — something which he believed has become increasingly evident over time as Canada's contemporary arts scene continues developing away from EuropeFulford concluded his column with an observation about how Toronto is similar yet different compared to other cities around North America : "Toronto can only boast a few buildings by world-renowned architects and there are no great works in our public spaces. But it does have some wonderful artwork - at least one piece of street art that I know all New Yorkers would love" . He went on further saying, “I was reminded this weekend just how much we enjoy being part of the global conversation – whether it’s through music or film festivals , fashion shows featuring international design talent or simply walking down Yonge Street where you see more postcards from abroad than anywhere else”## See also: Canada' s contemporary arts scene

The village of Tebingtinggi refers specifically only a narrow strip between <unk> River and the coastal area . This place was chosen because there were many hills around so that no other people could come easily.After Tanjong Sari became known among British colonial administrators , they had plans developed by James Wickham , an engineer from Singapore who visited Iban settlements along Klias river at 1867-1902 period when headhunters still lived in forest areas near riversides which was then considered to be under control or protection due to their past history with local authorities such as Sultanate Perak during early Malay sultanates era before being absorbed into modern Malaysian state system after independence on August 3rd, It is not clear whether the name "Tanjung Batu Gajah" has anything do with Tanjong Sari but it could refer either place where they found skull collection points ,or else a reference towards nearby hill called 'Bukit Pelabuhan' (Port Hill) .The British Colonial Administration tried several times over many years until finally succeeded in establishing an outpost at <unk> River mouth around year 1902 when their first base was set up there.

The original name for this town is " Kepliang " or 'Pekan Pengeliang' ( Hokkien : Eng lien kia pah ) meaning 'Town under Lord Liang '.In 1864 , the British government asked James Brooke if he would take up responsibility as a protector of Sarawak . He agreed but wanted help from Britain in order to strengthen its military capability ; hence Bintulu was selected because it had an excellent deep-water port with good anchorage and ample fresh water supply from the river banks that could serve both commercial shipping traffic and naval vessels. In April, three warships arrived at Keplian which included HMS Carysfort ( Captain William Warrender ), HM Gunboat Merlin ( Commander Evan Money )and another unidentified ship under command by Lieutenant John Fraser .By November , Brooke decided to establish a new settlement near Fort Keppel as his main residence for Sarawak government administration purposes instead of Sandakan on Sabah island due to its better accessibility via Sibu River compared with other rivers in Borneo such as Rajang or Rejang Rivers that were too shallow even during high tide times.

The Timbers Department was responsible for issuance permits on logs exportation from Sarawak through Brunei Bay which allowed exporters to trade with Indonesia and other countries without having to pay duties or taxes imposed by both Malaysian government at that time under British rule. However, during this era there existed no regulation policies put forth against illegal logging practices within local communities except those who committed crimes related offences would be prosecuted accordingly .On July @ ,@-@ -076954 , the first sawmill in Bintulu operated by M/s Pahang Merbau Sdn. Berhad commenced operations whereby they produced logs measuring about six inches (12 cm) thickness & width ranging from one foot eight inches upwards as per specifications requested for export purposes; these were used primarily as construction materials mainly due to high demand levels experienced at that time throughout South East Asia region which continued until early nineteen seventies before gradually diminishing over subsequent years thereafter resulting into closure of mill operation sometime during late 1983 .As a result, many local villagers became unemployed and migrated elsewhere seeking better opportunities available through oil exploration activities carried out by Shell companies operating in Sarawak waters especially those living around Bintulu town area who had no choice but move away since their livelihoods depended entirely upon timber industry. Others resorted taking up fishing jobs offered by Chinese owned boats plying along coastal areas surrounding Pulau Laut (Island) where they worked long hours under harsh conditions just to earn enough money for basic necessities such as food

In fact, only one bridge connected all these towns together: "Sarawak Bridge" which linked Kuching and Miri across Sarawak River on 30th December 1958 during reign by Sultan Iskander Mahmud Al-Haj , who also served briefly under British rule before becoming independent in August same year as Prime Minister at age twenty nine following his father's death from cancer three months earlier while still ruling over Saroway Province .The first bus that serviced the Bintulu – Miri route was owned by MARA ( Malaysian Agricultural Research Association ) . The government agency provided public transportation for people living within its jurisdiction, including those residing outside of Kuching city limits but not far enough away to warrant their own vehicle or motorcycle license plate number. This initiative allowed villagers access into other parts of town without having pay extra fees like taxis

The monument is located on Jalan Pekeliling near Raja Tun Uda Stadium, now renamed Majlis Perbandaran Bandaru Indera Mahkota stadium , also called MPBI Stadium or more commonly referred to by locals as “Taman Merdeka” which means Independence Park .In early days Bintulu was one big swamp area surrounded only by rivers such the Santubong River ( Sungai Baram ), Tanjong Sepatuk Bay and Tiong Aman river mouths where villagers lived in stilt houses built along the banks of these waterways with wooden bridges connecting them. The main source of income for local people then were fishing activities from boats, collecting firewood at nearby jungle areas, traders selling rice , kerosene oil products etc imported via cargo ships to sell locally or exported overseas using small sailboats called “pinisi”.Today Bintulu is a modern town surrounded by rubber plantations owned mainly by Chinese Malaysians who are mostly businessmen engaged in timber logging operations . There has been rapid development since 1970s when oil companies started setting up their facilities here due its strategic location near Indonesia border where they can easily access cheap labour resources available there. Many people migrated from Sabah and Sarawak during this time period looking for jobs but unfortunately many ended becoming squatters living around city limits as no proper housing provided them at that point of times until recently with introduction Housing Development Corporation (HDC) projects such “Taman Bintulu Utara” which was completed last year providing quality affordable homes to public sector workers residing nearby areas like Tiong Aman .Bintulu

There has been speculation over why such high numbers when compared to other major oil producing countries . A senior official from Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) stated " We have no plans of employing more than 10 ,00 employees for the entire project."The growth rate is significantly lower than its neighbour Sarawak 's capital city Kuching which experienced a 4 % population increase in just one year alone between July,25th & August,3rd according to statistics released by Malaysian Department Of Statistics as reported on the local newspaper Harian Metro .

While it was originally planned for Kirby's Adventureto take place in outer space like previous installments had done before then during development work began shifting towards having this game set inside an underground cave network because Nintendo believed players wanted more than what already existed from past games involving spaceships exploring different planets etcetera."

As well the name of each person was usually not recorded on th e grave .The Commission is supported in its work through contributions and donations made towards specific projects or memorials dedicated t o members who gave their lives for our freedom including both Commonwealth forces as w ell as those that fought against them. The main office fo r this purpose lies with an organisation called "The Royal Commonwealth Exhibition Fund" which has been raising money since before WWI when it became clear how important preserving records would be after hostilities ceased; however nowadays there are many other ways people can help out too: by sponsoring a particular soldier's headstone at Arlington National Cemetery (for example), buying one of these special pins from Canada House London, donating some land near where they died so future generations know what happened here or simply giving up their time through volunteering on site during working hours . It is worth noting that although most visitors come just t o see those buried within its grounds , anyone wishing to take part in commemorative ceremonies like Remembrance Day must first apply for permission which will require proof tha t you have completed training courses related either directly with serving members themselves OR indirectly via organisati os such as The Royal British Legion Association whose membership includes former service personnel who were wounded while fighting alongside them too; however this process should only be undertaken after consultation wi thin local authorities

They therefore devised a scheme for making more permanent provision at battlefield cemeteries by using precast concrete crosses as headstones (rather than wooden or stone ones). These crosses had numbered tags on them to indicate where each grave's remains lay beneath; this method was not immediately successful due to difficulties encountered during assembly of the large numbers required but did provide better protection from damage in future years . The Graves Registration Commission also introduced standardised forms that recorded details such as name rank regimental affiliation date and cause death place of birth occupation age next-of - kin address etc , which helped facilitate efficient identification processes even after hostilities ceased.= =2019=256463879=

The first meeting took place at Buckingham Palace on 29 May to discuss the terms o f reference which provided that “the Commission shall have power generally …to erect memorials…and also to secure suitable places, whether within cemeteries already established and maintained otherwise than as a government measure.or not”. When the final agreement was signed by Lloyd George (now prime minister) it made clear all graves should be marked with an official headstone: this meant commissioners had no option but t o actively seek out those unmarked burial sites of imperial soldiers scattered over France , Belgium or elsewhere . As well they were required under its powers “to keep in repair any grave or monument” including tombstones – which explains why so many are now missing from these battlefields .

> ater only for those who had made their mark on history by winning medals or achieving high ranks. The same principle applied when deciding whether commemorative monuments, such as crosses carved into stone slabs with inscriptions listing fallen soldiers' names (known in France today simply as 'stones'), could differ according to rank; they must all look alike. Moreover this committee did away with a number of other symbols associated wi th war and death: flowers were not permitted ; head stones or tombs were prohibited . In addition to these rules the Committee decided upon an architectural style which was adapted from classical Greek : simple obelisks made up entirely o f white marble , without any decoration on them except for their letters engraving name s , regiments, battalions etc., forming one uniform group throughout each cemetery so that there would be no distinctions between officers' graves (whereas in France different styles of crosses had been used according to rank). This project became known as ' The Great Cemeteries Project'.Another reason why this policy has received little recognition is because it clashed with popular notions about how war should have been conducted. In Britain and other Western countries the idea was widespread among soldiers at least by 1920-that they were fighting an imperialist war on behalf o f their rulers who did nothing but exploit them . One such soldier , Harry Snell, wrote a book called The Soldier Speaks after returning from service which advocated the creation of common graves for all ranks ; he also suggested that those buried in these cemeteries be commemorated through memorials erected around t h e world rather than individual head stones so as to avoid class distinctions within British society (although this would not have been possible since most Britons lived abroad).D

The decision was made to have the cemetery situated on high ground overlooking Jerusalem as it had been decided early during World War I that an Anglicised section of Mount Zion would serve no purpose, nor could any such site near Damascus (as suggested) ever become available due to international politics involving France and Turkey  . As well as being placed within sight of the Holy Sepulchre , another consideration in deciding where best place a British Cemetery was "the provision by some body or other [of] shops" which were felt necessary.The commission chose Sir Edwin Lutyens from New Delhi who visited Israel for this project twice; once with Baker before he died on 1 January at Belvedere House Sutton Courtenay Oxfordshire and then again after his death when Mrs Olive Bucknall, wife of Herbert John Buxton (a Commission member) took over leadership role during her husband's absence . 24 May marked their first meeting between the architectural duo as well members representing The Imperial War Graves Commission including: Francis Hitching , William Robert Ware & Henry Wilson - all three serving officers in World war I.The site chosen was a hillside area just outside Jerusalem which had been used since ancient times for burial purposes; there were two sites considered by Lutyens : one at Sheikh Jar

The other two commissioners nominated themselves : Major J E L Kendall who had been Director General Army Works in India during World war I ; he was a member for some time before his death . John Morris-Jones Professor at Oxford University appointed to represent Wales; also acted as Secretary.In May the Commission took up its work with an appeal from Lady Desborough asking people all over Britain "to give us their help and advice". She envisaged that 20 cemeteries would be established by July, but this proved impossible because of difficulties getting land , much less agreeing on designs or obtaining funds.. It became clear it could not function without financial assistance: The government agreed to provide half the cost while local authorities contributed one quarter each . Private donations were sought alongwith some corporate fundraising such as that undertaken for Westminster Abbey in London which raised £1473.The War Office was asked whether a temporary wooden chapel might be erected at CWGC Brookwood until an appropriate building could become available : the response received from Sir Neville Lyttleton , Secretary Of State For India,was "I am afraid I cannot accede  ...to your request". However permission was given by Colonel F L Maitland-Wilson, Director General of Graves and Memorials Department (DGGM) to take over the existing shell hole cemetery west of Ypres . The Commission also took on responsibility for four small British military graveyards in France which had been neglected following World war II.The first cemeteries were opened before end October:Bradford (Ripon Road

The woodland planting of trees, shrubs, perennial herbaceous plants were designed so that they would bloom throughout spring into autumn.The original plan for graves contained 105 plots but there are now over two thousand burial sites at Le Touret Military Cemeteries which include all ranks from both World War I & II as well as nurses in WWII and commonwealth servicemen who died during service after independence . Overall the Commonwealth Plot contains approximately 72% British casualties with French , Belgian or Canadian soldiers making up most of rest . The cemetery is open daily between dawn to dusk except on Remembrance Sunday when it opens an hour earlier than usual (9:30 a.m.)The Battlefields Memorial Park was established by Royal Engineers, who were responsible for building many military installations including bridges and roads through France at that time ; they constructed this memorial park which today has become one of five major sites managed by CWGC in Northern Europe : <unk> Memorial Parks & Gardens Foundation .   In addition there are over 15 other smaller parks with monuments throughout the country , each dedicated either as " Commemorative or Monumental" gardens containing either grave markers only -without names-or commemoration plaques honoring specific individuals killed during World War I . The latter category includes both Commonwealth soldiers (the vast majority) along side French national servicemen who died fighting alongside them under command orders issued from British high headquarters located at Chantilly near Paris before May 20th when France officially entered into hostilities against Germany after being invaded by German forces advancing through Belgium towards Northern France following their successful campaigns in Poland and Luxembourg earlier that

> ; however it was soon realized that this would be too few so the decision was taken instead for all those without graves or names among them as well (at least) one stone cross. This number grew until eventually there were more than twice as many memorials erected by British Imperial forces then any other country combined with a total of over half-a million casualties across Western Europe remembered collectively at almost three thousand different sites .### After World War I: Legacy & Relevance Today? : 1930 – present day / future developments in cemetery design and maintenance ??????/Despite its size , however, only some sections remain open today due to falling numbers since the end Of WWII - particularly among younger generations who are less likely To remember those lost during conflict times Or even have A connection With their Ancestors buried within these grounds anymore ... For this reason many local councils now choose instead To focus On other areas such As parks or green spaces when it comes time for new burials . In addition there has also been an increase over recent years towards cremation rather than traditional funerals ; which means that fewer people may eventually be interred here at all unless something changes soon enough. At present though , The Cemetery remains open throughout much of its yearly schedule (with certain exceptions) - allowing visitors access From dawn till dusk every day apart from Christmas Day itself! It’s important however not just take advantage Of This opportunity without giving due respect And consideration For Those Whose final resting place we find ourselves standing upon; hence why signs clearly state No dogs allowed within these premises !

> ," but other maintenance issues remained outstanding"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report describes an investigation into what is known about burials at Exeter (St Thomas) Cemetery, Devonshire. A total of three hundred eighty nine interments were located during this project which extended from July to October, All these individuals are commemorated on gravestones or memorial tablets in St Mary's Churchyard and have been identified as being buried elsewhere because the cemeteries in question do not hold any records for their location there . The church has had a long association with funerals , beginning when it was used by King Athelstan before he built his own abbey chapels on Ottery Hill near Sidmouth . In 1850 an Act passed Parliament that allowed burial at Exeter Cemetery (St Thomas) after its opening under the superintendence of two trustees. For many years prior to this, interments were taking place within parish boundaries which are now classified as unconsecrated ground and therefore no longer available for use ; thus leading into what is known today as 'ex-parochial' cemeteries in Devon such a St Mary's Churchyard , Heavitree Road or Bishops Tawton Parish Council land etc These bodies have been reinterred by the local authority . The first recorded burrial took place on 26th September that year when Elizabeth Hill was laid to rest there at an estimated cost £150 ( approx. =£943,87) . It should be noted however that records of interments before this date do not exist so it may well prove impossible ever know exactly who was buried where during these early years. As time passed and more people died they were no longer able to

> e Civil Wa r, there were attempts made between 1983 to remove graves from Beirut North British Military cemeteries but these failed due to protests by Muslim clerics. In some cases, such as during World Wars I or II when many soldiers died abroad (as opposed t o national wars where most casualties are local), war memorial commissions could have no control over how their dead would be buried because they had not been present on site prior in time for burial arrangements. The example given is that of United States Army Bur ial Services being unable u ntil after the end of hostilities at Arlington National Cemetery .[21] [24][89][30].The death and destruction caused throughout wars has often led to cemeteries becoming battlefields themselves , particularly those located close to major battles or trench lines such as British Soldier's Graves (Grave 57) near Neuve-Chapelle during World War I which was later converted into a French war memorial park; this resulted in some families removing remains from their ancestors’ graves elsewhere. In other cases, burial grounds have been used for nonmilitary purposes after the end of hostilities when they were no longer needed by arm y personnel . The example given is that o f Cemetery Road being renamed and redeveloped with housing estates built on top due t o its proximityto what had previously servedasanairbasefortheRAFduringWorldWarIIinAldershot ,HampshireCemeteries can be located outside cities or towns where local populations are small (such as those found along roadsides), in rural areas such astheGreenFieldcemeterynearBoston , Massachusetts which contains more than 10,056 burials from the American Revolution

Nevertheless , a number of databases and transcriptions exist to aid researchers seeking family members who died while serving with one or more branches o f HMF between 1914 - @-@ The following section therefore provides details both relating directly to such sources ( including those held within Findmypast ) along wi th links t o further online resources.The information contained on these records may also prove useful when attempting identify relatives buried elsewhere throughout Britain & Ireland, although it should always b e remembered that commemoration through membership has no necessary correlation with service during WWI; nor indeed does inclusion in any particular database necessarily indicate proof beyond reasonable doubt of a direct linkage .

The main access road into each site usually follows an alignment that provides good visibility in both directions (allowing sightlines to pedestrian traffic) as well as providing convenient vehicle turning space near entrances/exits. Pedestrians walk on the grass pathways , which provide safe footpaths between headstones and other features such after crossing areas provided along paths where required .The cemeteries contain many different types of feature including: War Graves ; Individual graves with or without upright gravemarkers; Memorials commemorating casualties from a particular campaign, battle etc.; Groups of burial plots for individuals who served together during wartime service but were not buried in one location at their death (e g : Commonwealth soldiers who died while serving overseas); Family groups – usually two adjacent plot lines containing up to four family members each. The layout is typically rectangular although some sites have been designed as elliptical , hexagonal and octagon-shaped .The cemeteries are laid out symmetrically around the central axis which runs through both main entrances into each site ; this gives them an overall sense symmetry that reinforced by uniformity within individual areas such as headstones on gravesites being aligned along similar axes throughout these sections of landscaping

Instead they often have one or more vertical elements such as columns sculptures angels statues obelisks canopies etc usually made from stone bronze granite marble stainless steel concrete plastic wood and other materials that would stand out against either lawn mown green turf or hard surfaces The most common form for post World War II monuments are freestanding upright flat slab crosses (of varying sizes) with inscriptions on the face , in which case it is called an "inscribed marker" rather than a headstone . There may also be horizontal plaques set into walls memorials trees shrubs flowers flags benches railings fencing gates doors curbs pathways buildings statues pools water features hedges sculptures murals etc20th-century cemetery grounds have seen many changes from earlier eras. With better transportation and communication technologies people were able to visit their deceased relatives more often during Victorian times. As such there was increased demand for burial sites within cities themselves so that families could easily reach them by foot or carriage without having too far of an inconvenience in traveling distance between home residence business workplace church school community center hospital fire station police department post office bank building library museum art gallery theater concert hall opera house courtroom jail prison asylum sanatorium mental institution retirement facility nursing care long term rehabilitation assisted living complex etcThere are also many other forms which may be found on military cemeteries . For example , a memorial wall is one where individual names and inscriptions from those killed during combat operations appear instead of headstones. This type was used extensively by American forces after World War II until it fell out favor with veterans who preferred more traditional markers such as crosses stars flags hearts eagles

The use of flowers is integral , where possible, as an avenue-way leading towards each grave site ; these paths have been laid down over time by careful placement and design so they blend seamlessly into one another forming beautiful boulevards which offer peaceful contemplation amidst nature's beauty when walking past family memorial stones or sitting quietly under trees waiting for loved ones who may visit them later on within their final resting place(s).   <unk>

> yens had collaborated with Gertrude Jekyll since 1903, when she designed flower gardens for his country house projects ; her influence can be seen on some New Southgate War Graves.In response The Imperial War Graves Commissions' Architect In Charge , Captain Wilfred Clement Von Berg (1874- ) created a memorial garden at each cemetery site which included trees, shrubs and grasses chosen by Miss Jekyll in accordance with their suitability as background planting or hedges that would grow to form natural boundaries around the burial areas . These were supported by Lutyens 's architectural structures including entrance gates flanked symmetrically either side of main paths leading from roads into the graveyard sites ; central chapels aligned along axes defined between gateways; low walls forming enclosures for small family plots surrounded on all sides except one where there was an opening onto another path. The design principles employed here became a model followed subsequently at other cemeteries such as St Sever Cemetery, Rouen , France and Brookwood Military Cemetary in England's Surrey county .The Lansdowne Road War Graves site is situated to north-east corner near junction with Stratford High Street (A106) about 2 miles east of Walthamstow town centre and approximately halfway up the lengthy road that leads from Lea Bridge roundabout into Victoria Park; its location between two busy roads may make it difficult for some visitors arriving by public transport but buses serving nearby areas stop on both sides within easy reach. It was first established during World War I when a number of Commonwealth soldiers were buried here following an attack at German trenches which took place just south west across Lansdowne Road in September, 19th - October ,3rd . The cemetery continued to expand with further burial

Simple shrubs or flower beds may be planted at intervals along pathways as accents, but they should not detract from an otherwise unobstruct ed view across gravesites toward distant memorials such as chapels and mausoleums. Statuary is also often used in these gardens ; statues placed nearer th e headstones serve both decorative purposes - adding color with their stone finishes of various hue - while further away , more symbolic sculptures (for example angel figures) remind visitors that the cemetery's primary function i snot to provide a beautiful landscape for recreational use .A series o f garden spaces linked together by paths creates an open space effect which allows mourners t o move freely around, but still maintaining privacy within individual areas designated fo r families or individuals  who wish t obe close enough during services. In some cases where there is no room onsite due too lackof land availability or other constraints like noise pollution from nearby roads etc., communal graves may be used instead; these consist of several burial plots arranged in rows parallel with eachother , usually marked off only b y low walls separating them apart without any additional ornamentation whatsoever! These types oftombstones are often chosen because they provide a cheaper alternative comparedto single ones which require more maintenance over time since all stonework will eventually erode away leaving nothing behind except memories .In conclusion, cemetery gardens should always reflect both natural beauty and human sentiment  - making visitors feel welcome while respecting those who have passed on before us. A well-designed landscape can help bring peace t o grieving families by providing comfort through nature's tranquility aswellas

> r - November, approximately half a million burial sites were searched (with only about one in three resulting in an uncovering) ; furthermore, many soldiers' names could not be identified. In order to determine which corpses belonged with what unit or division it became necessary to make sure that each body had its own personal effects. The procedure followed was as follows:*Each soldier's belongings were placed on his coffin before he left England , so when they arrived at their destination there would be no doubt of identification; for example : a pipe case bearing regimental crest . There might also have been photographs and letters from home . Such items remained buried until the exhumation began (which is why such grave sites are often referred-to in war diaries by an abbreviation such as 'b/m' = baggage). In this way, most soldiers could still be identified even if their names did not appear anywhere else ; however, it should always remain possible to trace individual remains back through one or more units.*Each burial site was marked with wooden crosses , which were later replaced when new cemeteries had been constructed; these markers contained both a name plate and unit information - e.g., 27th Division Bn . A detailed plan of each plot then followed showing the position of every body (and sometimes also its rank) in relation to those around him: for example : '1st Lieutenant Cronin on left' etc .In order that this system might continue after hostilities ended there would have needed firstly an accurate record made during wartime ; secondly, it must be kept up-to date through exhumation work itself ; third ly , all corpses found should still contain their personal effects as they did when originally buried; fourthl y these items had been

As a result, plans for a new class built around this requirement began almost immediately; by October there was sufficient information available on British naval operations off Belgium's west coast which led designers at Germaniawerft (which had constructed Germany’ s first U-boats) into beginning construction with their own designs within weeks – these were ordered under contract number A3058 from HAPAG shipping lines .The Germans then requested assistance from Austria @ Hungary , who agreed but only after some negotiations due partly because they felt it would compromise German independence during wartime if too many vessels came directly through Vienna rather than being delivered piecemeal like previous boats built elsewhere in Europe or overseas by other countries. As a result, all five ships of this class were designed and manufactured at Germaniawerft while Austro -Hungarian authorities oversaw production locally; when completed each boat was named for an officer killed fighting alongside them against Serbia two years earlier (i e Kapitänleutnant Karl von Schönfeldt).= Design Details : =   The class had no distinguishing features except the fact that they used diesel engines instead of coal ones as well as carrying extra fuel tanks which enabled longer range . They also featured enlarged conning towers compared with previous types making it easier onboard operations especially during bad weather conditions such rainstorms etc., but these were unpopular because many crews found themselves cramped inside this small space whenever there wasn’t enough room outside due to poor visibility. Another issue was insufficient ventilation leading some men feeling sick from carbon monoxide poisoning while others suffered asthma attacks or bronchitis after spending extended periods below deck without fresh air circulation (which could take upwards 4 hours).= Dimensions

They would have two forward torpedo tubes and one or more deck guns, plus an anti-aircraft gun mounted on top.The Germans planned that each submarine would carry eighty mines as well; these could not fit into a typical submari ne's pressure hull without significant modification of its interior volume, so they chose instead to stow them externally (as is still done today by modern minelaying vessels). These external minefields — referred in German documents with the term " Yellow fields" , for their distinctive yellow paint scheme— were intended to block access from Britain across The North Sea . This was part of what became known as Plan Z ; it also included plans for larger surface ships and coastal fortifications. 1945.The first submarine ordered under Project UB I designation numbered V23; she entered service on September 8th that year after being laid down at Germaniawerft shipyard near Kiel during June or July earlier than same month (sources differ), but had been launched only four weeks beforehand: August third, which meant her hull still needed work done upon completion when finished building process began two days later — making sure all seams were properly filled & caulked so water wouldn't leak into compartments below deck level once vessel was afloat again following launch ceremony held shortly thereafter..

As designed, each boat carried five mines ; however , this number varied throughout their careers due to damage inflicted while laying them - See Notes section further down pageThe German submarine boats had double bottoms consisting of water-tight compartments between the outer hull plating above a watertight bulkhead ( "Torpedobewaffnung" ) that ran lengthwise along both sides. This created two separate pressure chambers and allowed for damaged sections or individual flooding compartment s could be isolated by closing off valves in those parts rather than having all tanks breach simultaneously as would have happened otherwise . The Germaniawerft-built UB II type was fitted with three torpe d tubes on either side at bow while Weser's design featured four forward launching positions arranged symmetrically around midships , although this configuration proved unreliable during service due to problems caused when water entered these spaces through cracks within hull plating panels which then had difficulty being drained out again once submerged underwater because they were not connected directly below deck level but instead extended some distance into each compartment before opening up towards stern where sea could enter freely without causing flooding issues inside ship itself!The German Navy originally ordered a total of 50 UB II type boats, with the first boat commission

In addition there was also naval personnel serving aboard HM Ships Eagle ( R05 ) HMS Malaya ( 36 ), LST  387 ; while the cruiser HMS Carnarvon Castle acted as guard ship for the fleet anchored in Algeciras Bay.The defence of British interests during this time is reflected by both strategic moves such a s Operation Ironclad , which involved landings on Madagascar island from Gibraltar harbour, but more commonly tactical measures against enemy attack; including air raids launched against French Morocco and Spain's North African coastal cities .

He also distinguished himself during operations against German surface raiders operating off South America, where he sank more than a dozen ships between August 6th and December lst - an achievement which earned him two Distinguished Service Orders on October tenth . His actions with regard these vessels are described below:On September twelfth , the Italian light cruiser 'Espero' was captured by HMS Neptune after she had been torpedoed while attempting passage through Trinidad Strait ( off Cape Horn ). This incident took place three days before Somerville received his first DSO for services rendered from May nineteeth until June thirtieth. The ship carried out anti-submarine patrols around South America, during a period when German U boats were making their presence felt in this region; indeed it is thought that at least one such vessel sank British merchantman Empire Talisman on July 29th .On September twenty eighth , another Italian cruiser - the 'Minerva' was taken prisoner by HMS Neptune after she had been torpedoed while attempting passage through Trinidad Strait ( off Cape Horn ).

The first major event of World War II occurred on September l6th , when Italy entered into an armistice with Britain & France following their defeat at El Alamein. In October Hitler launched his ' Operation Torch ', a combined invasion attempt through Morocco towards Spanish Tangier, but failed to take advantage of this opportunity because Vichy French troops had occupied all ports except Casablanca . This allowed Germany's U-boat fleet free passage and over 20% were sunk off Gibraltar during early November - a period known as the ' Second Happy Time '. On December I5th it was announced that German forces would be evacuated from North Africa by Christmas Day ( only nine days away ). This meant that both sides would need to transport large numbers back home before their ships could leave harbour for other duties.

Even if this concession had been possible in view both 01 France's neutrality and her objectionable political attitude towards Germany , there would have remained the problem caused by Franco-German relations : " our first duty is clear," wrote Lord Lothian, Minister at Berlin (from whom we quote) ; ". ..to avoid war between two European Powers with whose interests Britain has no concern whatever."It was therefore necessary when French demands became intolerably aggressive for London not only to resist them but also - and this involved a complete change of policy from that hitherto followed as regards their own countries ' colonies or dependencies under threat . They had been regarded simply 01 parts o f t he British Empire overseas , bound up inextricably w i th Great B r itain's safety an d foreign policy. Now they were seen by the Cabinet, on advice given by Sir John Anderson (who made his first official report after assuming office) " ..in relation with our interests abroad" ; ". ...not merely as possessions which we have inherited," said Mr Lloyd George later; "...but rather that these territories are now to be treated like a nation of nations and are justified if need arises for self-defence."Thus far was Britain prepared at least

On April fifth, Göring issued orders to prepare one hundred Junkers Ju-52 transport planes that were capable of carrying troops across water on their huge wings.The Luftwaffe's intention was not only a daring airborne invasion but also to disrupt Allied communications with Gibraltar by bombarding nearby Tangier . The whole region would be under threat from an attack originating either over land or sea , as well as from attacks coming both northwards via Spain into France along her northern coastline and southward through Portugal down towards Morocco ! With London already being bombed nightly there could hardly have been any doubt in Churchill’ s mind about the seriousness behind Hitler 's order for the destruction of his country!

Both operations had a common goal : To secure the south coast area from potential allied intervention while prevention further advance into Europe on land through Spain, France, Belgium etc. The plan called for an amphibious assault across several points along England’s southern shore: The Channel Islands ( Jersey & Guernsey ) and then Portsmouth – which are located at either endAt this point it is important to mention that during these periods there were large scale bombing raids carried out by German bombers over Britain in order "to destroy British morale" @-@ but also as part of Operation Sealion , they would have been used to knockout the airfields where the RAF'S fighter aircraft operated from .

In February, two bombs placed underneath HMS Newcastle exploded prematurely as they crossed No Man' s Land between Spain (then neutral) and Morocco occupied by Germany at that time. In April an air attack against Gibraltar failed when Spanish authorities seized German planes attempting to fly over La Linea de la Concepción in order for them cross the Straits of Gibraltar undetected from Africa towards England or vice versa , also during this month British agents succeeded in destroying a bridge near Cádiz with explosives .The Spaniards were given complete freedom within their own country except on matters involving foreign policy, which was controlled directly by Berlin through diplomatic channels . Most of the money came either as cash payments made direct into bank accounts under false names and addresses (the "bank method") or via couriers who brought it across Spain's southern border. The sizeable sums involved are estimated to have reached £150 00 pounds per annum for each agent working against Gibraltar - at that time equivalent to about three years wages paid out weekly ! At times these funds would be delivered in sealed envelopes with instructions not opened until after certain events had occurred such as when HMS Newcastle bombarded Algeciras harbour on May 24, but more often they were handed over directly without any prior notice .This money helped pay the salaries of agents like Pedro Gonzalez Lopez who worked undercover posing as a fruit merchant or Señor Mariano Arroyo y Carrasco whose cover was employed by The Spanish Royal Family.

The next month another three attacks took place against shipping at Malta and Alexandria ; in March there followed two more attempts.The last attack of this campaign occurred during May-June; it is notable because all five targets sank , with losses totalling over £50 million ($786 m) including two Royal Navy destroyers and an aircraft carrier : RFA Oligarchic Victory , SS Empire Heritage ("the first British ship ever attacked by a German mine" ) . In total 21 vessels were damaged or lost due to these operations, for the loss only one U -boat (U349 ). The most successful operation was "Werwolf", which caused serious damage on several ships in June 1943.In July of that year the attacks ceased after Allied intelligence had intercepted radio messages between Plazas's headquarters at Berlin-Charlottenburg station with its agents operating within Gibraltar and Malta detailing how they would be undertaking future attacks using mines planted offshore from both ports , as well as giving away their own codes . This allowed British forces time enough warning them before any more attempts could take place; later surveillance also revealed what became known among military personnel thereafter simply by acronym -"the Enigma machine". It was through this method (as opposed to breaking German naval ciphers) which enabled Britain’s cryptanalyst team led under Alan Turingto crack the Nazi high command's encrypted messages enabling vital information about upcoming operations or movements across enemy lines.The First World War saw significant use of submarine minelaying, with large numbers being deployed in coastal waters and offensive minefields laid around

He quickly found an ideal place for this : Tenerife Island - where there were plenty available caves which could be used as shelters after the operation.

The caves were formedwhen mineral rich waters seep through cracks in bedrockand dissolve calcite to form beautiful stalactites/stalagmites(tall white columns), draperies (hanging curtains) or flowstone when they mix with calcium carbonate from the air . They also contain helictite crystals which grow upside down instead because gravity pulls them towards ceilings rather than floors!The caverns are partof an extensive network that stretches over 20 miles beneath Pennyroyal County Kentucky but only one section is open for public viewing at this time due to safety concerns about collapsible areas within some passages caused by mineral deposits known as sinter deposited on cave walls and roof structures.

As a result it is possible that there were several pretenders for power -  but it seems unlikely they would have been able, as some historians suggest, simply by acclamation , to elevate Pertinax .

> e senate nor any other body or individual in Rome posed much threat at this time : there were no pretenders waiting around on some distant island, ready t o take advantage if opportunity presented itself. There was little danger either within Italy: Agricola's conquests meant Britain remained securely under Roman rule until his son Gaius Suetonius Paulinus had taken over command of Brittany from him ( cf. Dio 60A12-43).The death of Nero and the subsequent succession by Galba led indirect ly not only to a change i n government , but also affected the whole political atmosphere . By contrast with both Vespasian or Domitian - who would be emperors after their predecessor —, it is quite certain that there were no members among those surrounding Nerva other than himself whose personal ambition was such as t o prevent them taking advantage if an opportunity presented itself during his reign : they knew perfectly well th at this could lead inevitablel y either into civil war or else some sort of dictatorship. Furthermore, because he had been invited back from retirement and then elected by acclamation rather than through military prowess (in which respect he differed markedly f rom the Flavians), there w ere few reasons why anyone should have felt inclined to challenge him .It seems likely , therefore , th a t one major factor behind Galba's decision not only to accept Nerva ' s invitation but also subsequently try so hard himself before finally abandoning all hope was his desire for peace ; another may well be that it allowed time fo r those who wanted change - such as Macrinus or Trajan-to make their way into power. Yet neither of these men would become emperor until after 10 years had passed since Vespasian took over from Galba, suggesting again how little threat they posed

He is also credited with reducing or cancelling entirely other types on various occasions.The situation in Judaea itself was undergoing a major change at this time due not only, as mentioned above by Josephus’ account, but also because there had been no Jewish revolt for over half century and so it would have become normalized . Furthermore , since Herod died without any male heir around ten years earlier much land previously owned by him reverted to Roman control ; namely his second son Antipas received Galilee while Philip obtained Bataneia ( the southern part of Gaulanitis ) along with Trachonitiscus near Damascus which became known as Peraea after 30 AD.In addition we find that Judaea was divided into three provinces under Agrippa I: Samaria-Galilie, Judea proper including Idumei territory westwards from Eleutheropolos or Beit She'an towards Egyptian frontier , and finally Peraea extending southward through Arabah Valley between Dead Sea & Jordan River . The last two were ruled directly by Rome but they had their own governors appointed locally who administered them according to Roman law ; e.g., during this time Herod Antipas remained in charge until his death (48AD) when he became king of Galilee with capital at Tiberias instead being moved there permanently after 70 AD destruction due war against Jerusalem!<unk> <unk>.

These measures did not last long however: after only a year, financial reforms again took precedence over military campaigns because Nerva's generals demanded more troops which could be paid off with funds diverted away from public works projects .

He ended the longstanding conflict with Parthia by agreeing that Armenius was king under Roman suzerainty and thus eliminating a potential threat to Rome 's eastern frontier. This decision is believed to have been influenced both by Nero, who saw it favorably since it would result in greater tax revenues from Egypt (where Arminius ruled) as well an opportunity for him himself later onNerva also attempted without success reform of Senate procedure : he wanted themes debated publicly instead just being conducted privately among members themselves ; but this proved unpopular within their ranks , which did not want its influence diminished . After the deaths or retirement during his reign various senators became emperors such Marcus Ulpius Trajan and Lucius Aelius Seianus whose power base was firmly established upon ascension to throne. In addition Nerva' s reforms were beneficial towards those who had been exiled under Domitian, including Pliny The Younger (author) as well others like Juvenal poetNevertheless despite these achievements he died shortly after taking office in January AD82 at age around fifty-nine years old having ruled only two years five months; making him one among few shortest lived Roman Emperors   .

> nday scholars. Although it is true enough as far as history goes, this interpretation ignores political realities : an emperor's son would have been considered too biased for such power; on occasion even brothers had contended over imperial offices ; thus if anything, Dio should be credited instead for having observed one aspect of Roman politics wherein all citizens were supposed to enjoy equal opportunities: inheritance laws allowed anyone with sufficient means and connections (and more importantly , name) to attain any office .The death in 98 AD caused by illness or suicide after a long period suffering from depression was followed shortly thereafter - it is unknown whether the two events are related but many historians believe they may well represent an act intended as both farewell gesture towards his son Trajan who succeeded him upon Nerva's own wish despite being reluctant due mainly because he feared doing so would discredit himself among future generations; yet even though this theory has been debated ever since its publication almost twenty years ago no one can deny that such views remain highly speculative at best given how little information exists regarding either individual outside those few details provided directly through sources themselves .The legacy of Emperor Domitian, often known by the nickname “the Tyrant”, is a complex and controversial topic. The Roman Empire underwent major changes during his reign (81-96 AD), including political reforms to strengthen central power as well economic policies designed for greater efficiency in taxation collection while maintaining social stability amongst citizens living throughout Rome’s vast territory.[i] His rule also saw an increase in military activity against external threats from Germania & Dacia[ii], with some historians crediting him solely or partly responsiblefor muchof modern day Europe being colonized due largelyto these campaigns .The death of Emperor Nerva was the end of one era, but it marked a new beginning too -

Even so, he does manage to offer some useful insights into his personality : for instance when describing how Nero first came upon Galba as governor-general (legatus Augusti pro praetore) at Hispania Tarraconensis and was immediately impressed. He saw a man who had been well educated but who lived simply enough not to appear overly arrogant or haughty; one capable yet humble & mild mannered with whom it would be easy working together .The historian Tacitus , writing in his Annals [Annales] the year after Domitian's death, offers more information than any other source: he is both critical of previous emperors like Nero for their cruelty towards senators as they sought power while simultaneously defending them against accusations that such acts were committed out of greedy ambition alone (a common misconception at this time).

As such I was forced into winning by default which made my opponent angry enough wherein he threatened physical violence towards myself unless we play another round later tonight after our school's basketball team plays an away-game tomorrow night...which meant that now not only do i lose everything but also risk getting beat up since everyone knows how much money you earn from playing pool games here every weekendEddie loses a third match against Fats . He returns home to find his mother has been murdered, and the police have arrested him for her death. They believe she committed suicide because of financial problems caused by losing so many betting matches with Bert , who had given them all this information beforehand without any proof whatsoever ! The officers refuse point blank any explanation as they escort their suspect outside into an awaiting patrol car whereupon one officer says "You're under arrest," while another adds " For your own safety"...

In response, an enraged Edward finds himself in another life-threatening situation when he accidentally kills one of Martha 's friends during rough sex atop Billiard Hall.Edward is placed on trial and convicted as guilty of manslaughter with the aid from Sarah who testifies against him because she doesn’t want to lose money for a 2nd time due to Edwards actions . Eddie escapes prison , but decides that it would be better if they both went their separate ways ; so after losing everything through his own bad luck (and perhaps more importantly) Sarah's bad judgment, an enraged Edward spends much-needed cash in order pay off all debts owing by Bert before he returns home without having lost anything at least this one final bet.Edward finds himself living out on the streets where he encounters Martha again and asks her about life insurance policies; when she says no because there is too high of a risk involved with such plans - which leads him back into pool halls once again looking for another chance against death itself!The film ends abruptly as we see Eddie walk away from billiard tables after winning enough money so that now instead being homeless ,he can buy his own house . But unfortunately even though everything seems good in terms earning potential ; it doesn’t seem like much has changed since they first met each other many years ago (even if only one person knows)...

He approached Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel who agreed the story would be perfect for them . Accordingly in October of 1970 they signed up as director-star respectively ; later adding Brian Garfield as screenwriter , based upon an original treatment by George Rowe , which itself had been developed over several years from Tevis ' novel. In addition to Mosconi (whom he knew personally) and some other pool experts were hired on consulting basis: Linda Butler, John Bender, Bill Sharpe III; Jack Moss was their technical advisor when it came time for filming the scenes with cues sticks at play.After this picture's success Warner Brothers offered Eastwood a contract that included ownership of two films per year . As such they agreed in 1972-3/4 , starting his own production company Malpaso Productions Inc., which has since been used as an umbrella name under which all projects are released worldwide through WB Home Video etc.. (until recently renamed Clint Eastwood Entertainment).  This deal also allowed him to continue making western movies like High Plains Drifter and Joe Kidd, both directed by Siegel; it was said the studio bosses were glad not having another Kirk Douglas around!The budget for The Enforcer rose from $65

George Cukor was originally considered for direction before Rossen took over because of his association with Katherine Hepburn (who starred alongside Spencer Tracy in Adam'S Rib ) whom he wanted as a co-star. She turned him down though and Marlo Thomas agreed instead on the condition she didn t have to play pool .During filming , Marlo asked director Robert Rossen if one scene would show her playing pool well enough so people wouldn 't know how bad at it really is  . The answer from Rosson : "It won’t look that good" ;  however, during production on another movie, Paul Newman was said by others who were working there too , to be practicing his own skills for this role (and thereby improving them) ! Hepburn finally withdrew when she found out about a kiss between Jackie Gleason and Piper Laurie. She later described the script as having been written in such an over-the-top manner—with characters constantly shouting things like “That's no way!” or “I gotta go” —that it made her feel uncomfortable .## Plot summary 1960/74 versions )   There are two different cuts of The Hustler : one from '68 , starring Paul Newman ; plus another version that came out during 2 years earlier (1953) with Edward Norton playing pool instead !

It is widely believed by critics such as David Thomson who wrote " No one could have seen how good he really was until _The Hustler_ : the masterpiece of American cinema in the Fifties and early Sixties , which, like all great films that break with convention (in this case about pool ) makes you see things differently forever " [ 3 ]During shooting Gleason clashed frequently with Robert Middleton -- another actor whose life had been on a downward spiral before his role in The Hustler reinvigorated it Rossen's screenplay called for their characters to be enemies but they worked well together during filming . However after making The Professionals co -writer / director Lewis Milestone dubbed them ''The Mutt & Jeff of Hollywood'' due to the contrast between them :"One was over six feet tall and looked like he could kill anybody, while Jackie stood around five-foot seven , looked as if you should never get into an argument or fight " [ 4 ]Gleason 's portrayal earned him critical acclaim including nominations from both the Academy Awards ( Best Actor ) Golden Globe Award ( Most Promising Newcomer Male) and Writers Guild Of America .

> ilst this may seem like an insignificant detail it indicates that although there has been some social advancement for Edward, he hasn ’ t yet reached total acceptance by those around him.Rossen also used various camera shots ( e.g., close-ups and medium longs ) to emphasise specific elements of the games such as showing emotion or expressions on their faces which added another layer to understanding what was happening between them at any one time during these sequences but they were not always effective because sometimes Rossen seemed more interested with shooting from odd angles than conveying meaningful information about Eddie ' s character . For example , when Bert is playing Findley in a two shot where both men are looking downwards towards Sarah who has just entered into view, this could indicate that something important may be going through her mind ; however if we look closer then all three characters appear very stiff-faced and awkward so there seems no reason for either man (or woman) feeling particularly uncomfortable around each other – which makes it hard to understand why anyone would want them together anyway!The only exception was during one scene involving an argument between him & his mother over money matters; here he looks away from camera momentarily before turning back again - showing us how upsetting things can get sometimes but also letting us know when someone's feelings are genuinely hurt by what another person has said or done . This particular shot works well because not only does Eddie show emotions through facial expressions alone ,but we learn something new about himself too: that even though everything seems fine on the surface level (i.e.,no real problems exist) there still lurks beneath those calm waters some hidden depth which makes them dangerous if unchecked!Rossen was clearly trying to convey a message with this film, and he succeeded in doing so; however it’s worth pointing out here just how much effort went into making sure

> ounters along his way ; that's why I called my movie 'The Hustler'. It has nothing at all with gambling. That was just something else in order for him, you know ..." In this sense then we can see how Bert Gordon ( Paul Newman ) represents an archetypal antagonistic force opposing everything which makes up who Eddy Felson(Paul Newman)is as human being . So it would seem appropriate if they both had been played by actors of equal stature and reputation within Hollywood itself because ultimately a well-crafted film is only ever going to be as good , or better than the sum total of its parts ; thus by casting two such giants here I think that Rossen has made one helluva strong statement about what constitutes 'Humanity' in the first place. But more importantly this also shows us how their respective characters are not simply defined through some kinda stereotypical movie cliché but rather something which goes much deeperthan just simple archetypes themselves . This means we see these two men interacting with each other on an almost mythological level whereby they both act out certain roles assigned unto them from society itself (but really only at a personal level ) and so it would seem appropriate if they were to be played by actors of equal stature within Hollywood because ultimately that is exactly what happens here as well , you know ...

Too many reviewers seem unable or unwilling to grasp that one man can make such an extraordinary work without Hollywood resources . But it does happen — and happens often enough around us so we should learn how : sometimes the more difficult route leads to greater accomplishment than inevitable compromise , which is all too easily available at any studio when they need only call up their favorite director, whose name will guarantee them some kind of box-office success.If Roeg' s film has not achieved complete acceptance by critics (although its grosses have been consistently excellent) then this may be due partly because he himself did nothing after his first three films except act as a producer for other directors: " When I started making pictures my wife said ' You ve gotta do something you want . It took me twenty years." That was long enough ; and now that the masterpiece has come out it can no longer conceal itself from viewers who prefer to watch movies which make sense rather than those with illusory resolutions, or any resolution at all. Too often we are treated like children : given some action , not too much of anything else — so there is little chance to think about what this means in terms o four-dimensional space; but Roeg' s films insist on our involvement as intelligent adult human beings.This may mean that he does have a " perverse taste for par

He went on: ""There are many excellent touches here. Some scenes achieve brilliance as they glow with good acting or by their stark-clean setting in midtown Manhattan...."

Bosley Crowther in his review for The New York Times called it an excellent drama that showed that Paul Sloane had been wrong about Burton : he wrote: “He is no overnight star who has gone through a sudden transformation from boy to manhood; rather [he] seems more like one of those hard-bitten professionals whose backgrounds have led them into all sorts or adventures on their way up.”The Hustler was nominated for four Academy Awards , including Best Picture and won two . It earned $10 million at the box office during its initial release, but with limited showings due to Fox' s cautious approach. Following reissues in subsequent years it grossed an additional $25m worldwide by mid - century standards making it one of Newman ' s most successful films ( along side Cool Hand Luke ).  Despite this commercial success there were no sequels ; however a stage musical adaptation opened Off Broadway in June  1964 starring Henry Fonda as " Eddie" Felson opposite Shirley Jones who played Sarah Packard .## Plot summary and characters overview : The Hustler is set primarily within the confines of pool halls , but also includes sequences outside such establishments: including time spent at home with family members or on location filming scenes for various publications. In addition to these locations , much activity takes place aboard trains; which are used both by characters travelling between cities while seeking work ( e g., Edward G Robinson )  –as well those just passing through town during their daily commute from one job site another   Aside this primary setting there exists a few secondary sites

> Role. It was based on an idea by Pool Hall Junkies writer Walter Tevis, using scenes from that novel along with new material written specifically about characters introduced during playbacks between matches played against Bill Warfield (played once more by Jack Kehoe). Although most critics consider it inferior to its predecessor, many still praise its acting and direction; Roger Ebert called it "a beautiful movie" while Gene Siskel proclaimed Newman's performance as Eddie Felson one of his finest ever .The film became notorious due partly because the end scene involving George C Scott' s character  takes place inside a strip club , an element absent in previous versions which caused some controversy at time when such establishments were illegal throughout United States. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Actor In Leadin Role (Newman) & Supporting Actress(Piper Laurie).

> ten films deemed to be American film classics—in which it listed Pocketful Of Miracles at number seven on their list.Bette Davis, who had been nominated six times previously without winning an Academy Award until this win ( her first for Best Actress ), said that she considered The Hustler one if not THE most important role ever written for a woman and that Newman was so much better than anyone else could have played Fast Eddie Felson in his first match against Minnesota Fats ("I'm sorry I couldn't do more justice"). This statement is disputed by some critics because they believe "that there are many actors besides Paul Newman whom would make equally good or even greater matches with the character" but nonetheless commend him on portraying it well enough to earn such praise from Davis herself .Director: Robert Rossen.

> any input or inspiration to create Fast Eddie Felson, despite their obvious similarities.In 1974, John Guare wrote a play called The House Of Blue Leaves about a man named Artie Shaughnessy (played by Ben Gazzara ) who is an unsuccessful professional pool player , but he never refers directly to either _The Hustler_ nor its characters in it; however there are several references made within conversations between two different sets of characters. For example: "You don't want me on your team ... I can shoot the balls out from underneath my feet" and at one point near the end when his daughter Bunny comes into their home dressed as a nun .There have been many parodies based upon this film, including Pink Panther Strikes Again 1976 with Peter Sellers reprising his role as Inspector Clouseau ; The Fat Spy (1985) starring George Kennedy , which is set in Las Vegas; Pool Shark (2003), directed by Rodney Ascher featuring actors like John Goodman playing themselves against each other during an intense game of eight ball pool on top of cue balls.
