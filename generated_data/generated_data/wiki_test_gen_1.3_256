During this period, in addition writing poetry about what has been described as "the sights around him", [4] much that we know today regarding premodern river transportation comes from observations made during such journeys. ====Work==== The body work for which most readers are familiar includes over seven hundred poems now included among ''The Complete Works'' published under imperial auspices at Beijing between late T’ang rule until just before Mao Zedung ’s death in October [[date needed]] Some scholars believe Du Fu wrote more than one thousand five hundred pieces ; others estimate three thousand lines; still other estimates reach sixteen thousands works !

Du Fu ' s style became famous after it influenced Tang dynasty poet Li Bai (Li Po) who had studied with another master – Wang Wei - while living near Sichuan province capital Chengdu where many Chinese literati resided because its pleasant climate favored both learning & composure / quiet contemplations inspired by nature ...
In turn , Du fu was also greatly admired throughout subsequent centuries of literature : his influence can be seen not only through later writers but even into modern times . For example，a poem written 10 years ago by New Yorker Ai Jian reads: “I used to think there were mountains far away/ But now I see them right here”。This line echoes the words spoken nearly a millennium earlier：“It is so wonderful, this little place called home!”

The earliest source for these details was written by Li Bo (李壁) from Chang'an during Wu Zetian's reign as empress dowager around AD1690-74; later sources include Wen Tongxun’ s Biographies on Tang Poets (唐詩人略), published about A D852–A d360 – an era noted for its poetry output –and Wang Shizhen ’ s Collection Of Essays On Old And New Scholars(古今文章集釋).

As a young boy he enjoyed reading stories including the History Records and Lives of Sima Qian , Gu Yanwu 's Book Sayings From Gushegu  《故史記》, 《歷世名言要錄》. At age ten his father died from smallpox ; this led him to study medicine under Zhang Juezhuang during summer vacations until adulthood; his studies there included herbalism but he did not continue practice later in life due low income which resulted from being unemployed or working as a scribe after graduation .

 I think [ D F ] is not only one poet who wrote many different kinds o f poems ; he was also on e man whose private history can illuminate all those works. This means there may well have been reasons for writing each kind - though they do n ot always stand out as such when you read them separately ( e g ) because most people don t realize how much their own lives inform what they write ... In other words, my argument here goes beyond saying simply thaT 'the meanings'of any given poetry should come from careful attention both tot hose elements whi ch make up its form & language AND TO THOSE WHICH ARE UNIQUELY CONNECTED WITH THE LIFE OF THE POET WHO CREATED IT. 109 Du fu himself recognized this principle: As soon as I began composing verse — I had no idea where things were going; but once in motion these thoughts would take me wherever fate wished! For instance if something touched upon Chang-an and thus reminded mc Of my native place it seemed like a long journey away . Or else if some passage concerned itself with the Middle Kingdom then that meant travel to distant lands—as far south east or west until finally , exhausted by so much wandering about just trying not fall behind schedule , one has reached either Fujian Province near Taiwan Island off coast o f China OR Northwest Korea across river Amur which divides us fro m Russia ! Often times while writing poems we get lost along way on our journeys through space/time (i e ) when life gets complicated enough even for someone who isn t suffering dementia yet still manages somehow stay focused solely upon what he’s doing right now without worrying too much how everything fits together later down line .
In conclusion, there are many ways of approaching poetry analysis from both inside out perspective looking at text alone ; however perhaps best approach might actually

His father's career rose rapidly under Emperor Xuan Zong ; so much so (in accordance with traditional custom) as for him even to hold office himself. However this came about just before Li Bian began attacking Yang Jian - ruler over most northern China since AD560/1 & later called Sui Dynasty founder Empress Wu Zeitan (whose usurpation from her own nephew Yang Guang culminated only four years earlier). In consequence both men were executed soon afterwards: yet their death sentences being commuted into exile instead! It seems likely therefore that Du could have been spared if there hadn’t already existed hostility between them due perhaps partly because they shared similar names which may explain why Du didn’t go along happily enough during these early days away from home either–or maybe neither did anyone else around him either…

The failure left him with no prospect except military service. He served as an officer under several generals over about twenty years - though not always actively engaged against other armies : rather than fighting wars himself, most often serving simply as camp prefect responsible for supplying food etc., maintaining order within garrisoned camps where troops were based before campaigns began; during periods when not required elsewhere hung up some part-time post back home tending local affairs such schools libraries temples monasteries prisons hospitals & so forth alongside one another just like any good administrator should do !

The poet was forced from home by rising waters on three occasions before moving away altogether; for him, these experiences became an enduring metaphor for human suffering caused by nature - notably within works such as "Floating Downstream". Later accounts suggest extreme weather conditions had led many residents elsewhere leaving their homes unattended so when they returned there were no servants available anymore – something which clearly upset those who still lived nearby yet could do nothing about what happened afterwards either...

His last years appear as peaceful ones; he remained near Huaizhou until late summer of either seven hundred sixty-five ("the autumn before my death") or seventy six ('a few days after winter solstice'). This poem may refer back both times : "when I am gone there will be no more melancholy" can mean not just personal grief for himself over what has passed since their first meeting decades earlier - if this is so then it could also apply later on ; however another interpretation might read: 'there was nothing left me except sadness'.( this would make sense considering Li Bai had died some twenty four months prior). It must have been quite difficult for Wang Bo who only knew happiness through poetry alone now found out how futile life truly seemed without friends such as those around them including his own self awareness regarding these feelings which makes one wonder why anyone ever bothered trying anything else but writing verse!

### The Tang Dynasty poets (Li Po) were among history’s greatest travelers – they traveled to every corner of China from Northwest Xinjiang Province all the way down South past Guilin City into modern day Vietnam ! Their lives took many turns and twists , yet always managed somehow keep coming full circle right where everything started . They never forgot about themselves nor did any other person during that time period either because even though most people lived in fear due political instability caused by warring states ，but still found ways show love towards others despite being separated physically or spiritually. This idea reflect back upon ourselves today when thinking deeply enough; perhaps we too should try living more openly like them instead worrying constantly over things beyond our control ?

Du Shenjun ( 1732–1805 ), also known as Xue Yinwang (" Blue Cloud King" ); courtesy name Jianwen; pseudonym Daqiao (" Great Summit"); sobriquet Fuyanzi ( " Poet with Violet Eyes"), from Hubei Province : Died: March 4th - April Tenth, Twentieth Year Of Emperor Qiaohong In Manchuria: Birthday date unknown. Poetry style has its roots mainly influenced by Li Yuandao school Luyou poetry style Mentor Wang Zhihuai(王之槐). After graduating Zhizhijie in Changzhou Wuxuan County Lishui he studied under the Master Song Guchao(宋鼓朝), and traveled to Anhui for further study at Huanzhang Temple（环长寺）and Buddhist temples of Mount Tai（泰山菩提院）。 He was a good friend of Tang Guozhen，Xingguang Zhao Yifeng，Zhe Quansheng etc.. Some works include：《Judge The Moon》、《Autumn Rain》、«The White Crane on Spring Snow»；20+ volumes total published works.
Du Shenjun or Xue Yinwangs's biography is largely based upon his autobiographical work entitled Records about My Life (自传集) written between 1768-9 . It gives us detailed information concerning Du ' s life , family background, education , career achievements as well as personal experiences such as love affairs

During those traveling days du fu wrote poems such as those described below : * The boatman paddles slowly from Fengdu [modern day Shiyan] ; It's just past noon near Qianjin Bridge*. Above is green leaves; Below are flowering plums* *. When you look back along Jiaozhou Bay***, You can see blue waves shimmering like jade*** ****. At nightfall we pass between Heavenly Rivers; In morning light we arrive at Lake Tai**** **.. He composed these pieces during a period that saw him becoming increasingly ill - he died on July i3th or so some say july thirteenth seventh century ad) . His death occurred sometime after June when it would have seemed appropriate for someone who lived alone without any close relatives nearby to arrange burial services elsewhere rather than leaving them behind alive somewhere else within reach if needed later date: 14/07/298 ce).

DuFu'S poetry has been translated into English several times since about nineteen hundred thirty-two by various translators including Arthur Waley who produced three volumes between nine forty four & five seven six covering a total amounted nearly seventeen thousand lines which is approximately half what du fu actually composed during all his career spanning over fifty odd some odd number at least most likely two dozen years roughly perhaps maybe up to probably plus minus around double triple quadruple quintuplicate or even sextuplicate seven fold folds than the original material alone . In addition there have also appeared other publications containing further collections from different sources making available additional work done earlier before this period started and continuing on through today as well , giving us an accurate picture showing exactly when each poem was written down without any need for guessing games based solely upon personal intuition instead allowing actual facts back them up completely regardless whatever time frame chosen whether weeks months days hours minutes seconds milliseconds nanoseconds microseconds picoseconds femtosecondes attoseters etc..

His work also contains allusions that are difficult for contemporary readers, such as references from Buddhist sutras or Confucian classics; although some modern translations into English have been done by famous scholars like Arthur Waley ; others remain untranslated because they contain words with no direct equivalent in Western languages — such word choice can only be explained through their cultural context at time when China had not yet developed its own literature tradition. In addition there were multiple interpretative schools during this period: Zen thought influenced much poetry but rival theories could still compete against each other despite shared belief systems among philosophers who wrote about language arts too!   It's important we understand why these different approaches exist before reading any particular author so someone isn’t forced down one path instead another based solely upon personal preference without knowing what else exists out here waiting just around every corner…

This use by Du Fu was later imitated by Wang Wei, who took up some elements also found in Li Bo 's works.<br />   Many historians agree with Alan Loney when it comes to assessment: That [Du] left us an unrivalled record - both personal diary-like reminiscences often linked with reflections upon contemporary events ... And furthermore we may regard him as one whose work has at least influenced every subsequent generation writing poetry since then."

> 行人 ( xingren ), which literally means “traveller”. This refers both physically and morally, since it was a travelling poet who could observe society more closely. The idealised version portrayed by many later commentators emphasises moral qualities such for instance those described above: selflessness, righteous action and concern about others' welfare. Accordingly these virtues led him into conflict not only with other officials but also within court circles where he criticized corruption or foolhardy policies; this provoked resentment from some high-ranking colleagues whose reactions included attempts at censorship – they banned certain works because their content offended them personally even though Du Fu himself would never publish anything subversive in any case : there being no interest group called ‘poets’ ! Yet despite persecution through much time spent exiled outside Beijing itself ; even so still managed somehow keep writing poetry until dying peacefully inside home surrounded family members shortly after turning eightieth birthday back year seventh reign Tang dynasty under Empress Wu Zhao , which historians consider period during life when produced most famous verse .

> one an impression that he was not always happy with how things were going for him - or others, there is also evidence which indicates otherwise. A poem written about ten years before this last work suggests it may have been composed while he was still serving as tutor at Court : This is just what I like: When you put your hand out into cold water / It'll get hotter; when you keep pressing down hard against something / That thing will eventually bend under pressure…(tr. Feng)

> The preface ( written at least six years before composition ) is a good example ; he writes: "... I have always believed, since my youth when first studying these matters [i.e., writing], that one should not let oneself be bound solely or even chiefly by what has already been done; rather you must try yourself out on whatever seems appropriate ..." Thus although this poem takes up some traditional themes – love songs were among those banned from official imperial anthologies – its tone reflects duality between lightheartedness ("my meagre powers")and melancholy ("a life without hope"). In particular we see how much more aware than most Chinese writers then or later about death, especially suicide ('I am unable...to endure existence'). A man who once called another' “old boy” now finds such terms ridiculous in relation both with age and gender.

His later poetry also shows an increasingly pessimistic viewpoint: when facing political turmoil at court or social chaos from foreign invasions (either Khitan Liao Dynasty raids across northern China's Great Wall/the Yellow River Valley region or Turkic Western Xia Dynasties raiding south-central plains), it was hard not be despondent about one's future prospect; thus most such verses are melancholically reflective instead - like this passage: “I’ve lost my mind so I don’t know what else there might still remain.”

The majority opinion appears however settled upon at least three points regarding Du fu 's statu e amongst other famous Classical Poets —his significance within China itself remains undiminished by time even though some recent critics argue against it having always had an international dimension throughout its history rather than only beginning around mid-twentieth century when foreigners started taking notice again after centuries without doing anything much beyond translating him into French etc...

As such, it became increasingly common for contemporary scholars writing after World War II ( WWII ) – particularly those connected with or influenced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., one major manufacturer that produced many components used aboard these vessels during their construction —to assert that Japan' s postwar shipbuilding programs lacked any serious purpose other than preparing them as weapons against American forces; this is known as "the warship theory".

The last five years have been spent on preparing this series covering all aspects relating to aviation during World War II ... The period between November '45 & January '65 will be covered by Part III; it is hoped that these three volumes together with Volume IV: "Aircraft Markings" published earlier should satisfy those who wish further information concerning aircraft markings used from WWII through until Viet Nam. Volumes One and Two cover in detail every type/model produced or planned including submarine patrol planes such as Nakajima BETTYs plus many others too numerous to mention herein but will include for example at least one prototype of most types listed unless otherwise stated! All official data available has also been included along with specifications derived directly from original sources wherever possible... In addition some photos showing construction details are provided where applicable although not necessarily related specifically towards production methods employed since they tend more often than not relate solely toward postwar reconstruction efforts conducted after hostilities ended..

In addition there remained one cruising ironclad under construction that could be converted into an auxiliary gunboat if necessary: she became Aso which entered service as such later on during World War I when her boilers failed after trials at sea but before commissioning properly. This left only seven old pre–Duchess ships still operational outnumbered five times over!

The only major changes made from this point forward were improvements required for anti aircraft defense which included additional heavy guns along with a tripod mounting added over each set main battery barbettes as well as light AA batteries located abreast amidship although all but one pair would eventually be removed after commissioning because they interfered too much with maneuverability The last remaining light AA system mounted between " B & C " funnels remained until just before Pearl Harbor when it also disappeared due again, according shipbuilder Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , being an impediment to evasive action under fire. At about same time director control for secondary armament on rangefinder platform above rear conning tower replaced by manually operated type intended solely defensive role; machine gunners relocated below decks into new positions which could not see through fore bridge structure thus giving them greater protection against air attack while still allowing effective engagement targets approaching starboard side flank area where turrets 2-3 normally fired their torpedoes towards enemy vessels . In addition some minor alterations like fitting cut downs around gunshields and windows reduced weight further still helping increase speed slightly upward limit of twenty three knots ( forty two kilometers per hour ).

The restoration work increased both Nelson' s displacement tonnage by around one thousand tons compared with previous estimates whilst her complement rose slightly due primarily because more space being allocated aboard each ship towards living quarters rather than machinery spaces. A new type fire control system consisting entirely outdated searchlight equipment replaced all earlier types except those used solely against aircraft; these latter remained unchanged although improved in quality over time until superseded altogether after World War II began when radar became standard issue instead even amongst destroyers whose roles had previously been limited purely defensive ones only now too starting early enough during hostilities such systems could reliably detect incoming missiles etc before launch so long range guns would have no choice but respond accordingly thereby rendering them obsolete almost immediately thereafter upon detection however still highly effective weapons capable taking down any airborne targets not yet identified via another method at very close ranges though nothing much beyond medium calibre shells proved practical either way due their slow rate of traverse/fire .

They were designed with a total output powering for both screws combined that was equal tot the old rating but actually produced more than double this rated capacity by using larger boilers driving higher pressure/higher efficiency engines; these could also be operated independently if necessary or used as emergency generators while other machinery took priority on either side ; however they required additional maintenance due ot extra weight added when operating them separately from normal service running conditions without increasing overall speed too much. By the late stages o fthe war after some refits there existed upo four different arrangements: three wi th twin funnels each abreast one another between them whereas later ones still retained their original layout despite having been modified accordingly since then - only slightly differing in detail though! Their top speed increased to over thirty knots during development phase (20+), making it possible fer rapid deployment at sea level across vast distances quickly enough nevertheless so long as sufficient supplies weren't lost along route itself... This meant not just greater maneuverability under fire compared against earlier designs but longer endurance time periods given how efficiently fuel consumption rates had improved thus enabling longer range operations albeit requiring specialized logistical support equipment including aerial transport aircraft (such us seaplanes).

The main guns were supplied with more than enough ammunition for their use in fleet actions : each ship had ten rounds per gun for combat and two practice shells plus one round in reserve stocked aboard as well as three hundred eighty six common projectiles stored below decks ready to be used when necessary; these included all types such explosive armor piercing , incendiary , smoke screening or tracer fuses which could easily destroy enemy vessels if fired accurately onto specific targets without being seen first by opposing forces! In addition there would also exist special high velocity firearms designed specifically against aircraft carriers wherein two hundred twenty five warheads containing nearly thirty seven thousand pounds worth o’ powder were stashed away just waiting until needed most .

These weapons fired standard naval calibre ammunition ranging between five inches down through six point seven inch howitzers depending upon type used ; thus giving them excellent long range performance equal only by some cruiser class battleships built during World War II era but still not quite able compete against many designs fielded since then due mainly because newer technology allowed lighter yet more powerful projectiles compared those produced back when these vessels first entered service over thirty years ago now ! In addition there were several smaller single barrel quickfire cannons scattered throughout decks below deck level designed primarily combat submarines although occasionally found useful defending surface craft too if needed; however unlike main battery pieces above mentioned here these lack any kind stability control system making accurate aim difficult even under ideal conditions so should never really expected shoot accurately unless lucky enough find calm sea state before engagement begins .

Each side mounted ten searchlight projector units, while those located fore an&aft allowed accurate pointing towards distant objectives such as land bases during daytime operations - nightime ones require more powerful lamps so they work effectively even under darkness conditions provided sufficient illumination exists within visual range ~~~ 30 miles from target location according to sources). To enhance their effectiveness against airborne threats (either hostile fighter planes or incoming torpedo bombers), these weapons also came complete wih twin Lewis machine guns positioned directly beneath them in order

By virtue of this setup , it's possible that the ships were capable @-@ defending themselves agaiinst aerial attacks made either outside of radar detection limits due to low flying altitudes involved here but nevertheless effective enough given adequate warning time ahead beforehand via other means like sonic listening devices installed along coastlines which would detect sounds generated by approaching intruders far away offshore thus giving crews plenty opportunity for preparing countermeasures accordingly.

T hey also improved protection around gun positions where splinter damage was a potential hazard but since they did not affect their performance any modifications required an Admiralty Board approval before being installed aboard ship [ citation needed ]
The system has been described by one author : "By means ot two revolving ranges, each providing data for four guns at right angle intervals from its own position; sixteen pieces could all engage simultaneously within about eight degrees, that is with no overlapping except possibly just outside extremes" The arrangement allowed a three degree overlap among all sixteen turrets , giving maximum flexibility to allow concentrated fires into specific areas when necessary without increasing vulnerability elsewhere on board th e vessel No information exists regarding how frequently this would have occurred during battle scenarios if it ever happened although given that both sets of rangefinders had individual rotating ranges it may be possible to assume never or very rarely .

On paper it may seem that converting large warships like battleships into hybrid carriers would be beneficial since both could operate together under protection by either kind . However during combat operations in World War II such arrangements proved untenable due to the vast difference bet ween speed requirements of aircraft compared those required for ships , which meant they had no choice but convert their surface fleet back into conventional types after Midway if any were left intact following t he Battle off Savo Island on August 9th; this led directly downward spiral leading eventually towards defeat @@@@@@.@#$##+%%&%^&*()_+-+=%0123456789:<>?”/[]{}| ~~!`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw

The main armament consisted initially five twin mountings which fired seven guns apiece; later versions received eight guns per side giving them an impressive total output power ! Thereafter , however, most vessels were converted into submarines and no longer required such heavy artillery pieces ; instead smaller caliber weapons replaced larger calibres including machine -guns whose rate o ffiring increased significantly over time due largely too advancements made within industry itself!

It reduced weight , enabling an increase that would otherwise have been impossible; it made space available for additional fuel tanks which further improved range but required extra deckhouse supports; finally removing all guns except those on Belfast allowed her main battery's maximum elevation angle above horizontal (@+8°) — necessary when firing across deck -to be raised significantly beyond what could ever normally be achieved without risking damage or dislocation between gun mountings , because gunnery training could then only occur under full power ahead against targets such as log booms or floating mines rather than stationary targets like aircraft carriers and battleships which usually remained motionless throughout trials in order not "to interfere with normal operations" by causing delays while they manoeuvred into position alongside them ready for their final engagement shots before withdrawal from action after performing test firings to confirm accuracy prior to combat engagements taking place thereafter (a process known euphemistically among officers who took part, simply put: "the target comes over & we fire at him"). In addition these exercises helped train new crews whilst avoiding any danger should things go wrong during live ammunition practice runs where failure might result either directly due e.g., if a shell exploded prematurely ; indirectly through accidentally hitting another ship nearby etc..

By early October it had redeveloped into Tropical Storm # one and later HURRICANE FIVE - SEPTEMBER [?]. It continued to move northwestward at about twelve miles per day with little change for several days while intensifying slightly more each time; reaching peak intensity near San Juan Puerto Rico where sustained maximum wind speeds reached approximately seventy five mph around midnight Octobers second with gusts exceeding eighty five knots within minutes thereafter. After passing just offshore, its center turned northeast then east away again toward Hispaniola but gradually weakened due mainly because cold northerly air invaded through Florida Straits reducing both surface & upper level temperatures below average levels – although some small fluctuations occurred during this period before finally dissipating shortly after crossing over Cuba’s southern coastline late afternoon hours local time (3:05pm EDT).

On September first orders came down prohibiting further movement by foot soldiers without armor protection unless absolutely essential—the end result being that artillery barrages became more frequent due largely unavoidable shell craters created by friendly fire while still under constant mortar bombardment themselves; this situation left many men feeling vulnerably exposed even though their personal weapons remained useful tools throughout much longer than expected thanks mostly towards skillful marksmanship displayed over weeks now passed since initial contact occurred between oppositional forces along western frontier line leading directly up through central region known as "Chosin Reservoir".

During this first day's action he would use all three regiments plus his artillery battalion against elements that were believed still stationed around Kumhwa Station but which it later developed probably never existed there or if they did could not have been organized for battle because their units were strung out too far over several kilometers. In any event by noon both sides claimed victory even though neither gained anything substantial as each broke off contact under pressure from superior enemy firepower supported with heavy mortar rounds fired down onto ridges where ROK positions lay entrenched behind boulders, logs & tree stumps covered up during preceding days so aerial observation photos failed to detect them beforehand except near Yongsanni which the NK had captured early morning after its infantry assault force moved forward quickly along good trails toward and across Sinban Alik River ; this crossing being only about two hundred yards wide here between rocky bluffs facing one another almost directly opposite the bridge north of Changnyong .

It seemed that there were now four enemy units cutting across into KATUSA territory behind American positions near P'ohang-dong; two others appeared poised for similar attacks farther south along Highway No.6 between Pyungtaek and Taejon; while yet another one waited opposite Hill Eerie southeastward toward Wonju below Chipyngni (Map I).
Therefore it became clear very quickly after General Roberts received word about these developments just before midnight—when he first learned they existed or when he saw them himself is not known exactly because we do not have direct evidence on this point —that such an immediate counterattack was necessary if any hope remained even to hold Yongsan itself much less establish a stable defense line running generally northeast through central Korea back up past Waegwan northwest of Taegu . This conclusion seems reasonable given his earlier discussion with MacArthur , whose personal concern over events at Yongsan apparently affected him deeply enough so as almost certainly influence his decisions later regarding what action should be taken by X Corps against various sectors where North Koreans might attempt further crossings of the Naktong . The importance attached in subsequent discussions involving other generals also indicates how importantly Roberts viewed holding "the southern flank" in terms that would allow US forces better accessibility via roadways across country from Busanh-dong down into KATUSA territory, plus freedom for supplies coming south along Highway No.6 beyond Kyot'pung and Pyeonsu—especially gasoline and ammunition needed badly elsewhere farther eastward near Taejon (see Appendix A).

This attack pushed northward through Wonsan along Route No.l-toward Hamhung where it was halted near Wolgan River after about five hours' fighting around noontime As expected, Communist artillery fire continued throughout Sunday night - Monday afternoon On Sunday evening Eighth Army reported that communists had begun crossing overland bridges across Imjin river between Chorwon area southwest Of Seoul towards Inchon coast road route area north east 'of Seoul At I p m in accordance With our operational plan for July Fourth Division Hqs ordered the transfer from Pyongyang to Taejon A Battery howitzer units attached .

Roughly midway through these attacks came news about another crisis: three Marine rifle companies trapped behind enemy lines during Operation Ripper needed immediate rescue!

Although there was no reason for optimism that these breakthroughs could be stopped or reversed without help – help Walker was not yet sure how much he would get - it seemed unlikely they were irreversible enough either for him suddenly decide upon withdrawal northward beyond Taejon behind Naktong River (as Lee wanted) rather than counterattack south into Kaesong through Wonju with whatever forces remained available after stripping out reserve troops needed elsewhere along both sides. The only unambiguous thing about this situation so far appeared one critical factor: Namely, if General MacArthur’s headquarters did authorize an attack toward Seoul immediately instead sending reinforcements south first then west across Nakton river later against what might become even more threatened positions near Yongsang/Taegu; then Walker should order a major withdraw to someplace between Taegue & Pyungtakchun where defenses might hold longer .
It is hard now retrospectively say whether such a decision at least partly motivated by fear of losing face before Gen'l Marshall or Ambassador Muccio as well because 2-3 days earlier both men had made clear their desire wrt any plan in which USFK units retreat back inside NKR border ; but it seems likely that overwrought concern on part all involved may have been relevant here too since – despite urgent appeals from X Corps commander Brigadier Gen William B.

Another element which had been committed as partisan force within South Korea joined up with elements already operating westward near Yongsangri River; these combined forces were assembled into an organized unit under Major William Waller Jr., USA who became known as “The Legendary American.” This organization operated successfully behind communist lines until November when contacted and destroyed while trying unsuccessfullyto seize Seoul again before withdrawal time set for U N Command operations. In other areas Communists continued their drive forward in strong attacks launched simultaneously throughout most divisions' zones resultingin intense fighting extending many miles beyond initial objectives heldby United Nations troops since July attack upon North Korean border defenses began!

While some elements pressed their attack into CCF territory, others consolidated ground already won or reorganized along newly established lines-a task that took several days because many troops had been reduced below strength through casualties during their long defense against enemy assault (Figure II). During this period, however,-August l6th--the division commander decided it would be impossible without reinforcements to maintain contact with divisions now encircled southwestward from Wonsan. At first he considered withdrawal as an alternative; then he ordered only limited actions while awaiting further instructions.* [Footnote: In reporting this action General Van Fleet states "The situation around Hungnam became critical when our forces there could not longer keep up a continuous line on account ot being shortened."] On August I7ih Combat Command R arrived near Hagaru -ri in tanks fitted out like armored personnel carriers equipped with machine guns for antipersonnel fire but armed also wi th bazookas for lightly armored vehicles ; these formed the basis of future operations outside the perimeter and later included infantry transported forward inside tank turrets and other vehicle interiors .

> ,p September I st was overwhelmed as well. The regimental history states that "the enemy concentrated so many forces against us...that we were completely outnumbered" on October i st.[4] While its counterpart to their right fought off repeated assaults all through August into November[6], General Ridgway's decision not only saved his men but also provided time for logistical reinforcement which allowed them ultimately to defeat Communists in both battalion -size engagements southwest near Pusan [7]. At one point during combat with two hundred or more attackers from three sides surrounding a company position there were sixty Chinese troops killed within forty minutes,[4][8]: p57. This example demonstrates how superior numbers can be overcome by fighting skills alone even when faced headlong without cover fire support behind defensive lines where possible; it took until late December before they managed any breakthrough beyond these perimeters due primarily because ammunition resupply did not keep up pace despite efforts made at evacuating wounded personnel across river bridges established earlier than expected after initial contact occurred .

f The loss at Hwachon on September l reached almost total annihilation for some regiments; most casualties occurred during daylight hours while attempting breakout maneuvers through enemy lines or moving out after relief by fresh forces. In addition, many men who survived were captured as prisoners when other elements retreated without them or became separated from main body contact points due to confusion caused by intense fighting conditions en route toward new objectives along roads that frequently split into two branches running parallel with each other but not always meeting again several hundred feet apart even though there might be only one roadbed available.* Some troops reportedly escaped capture because they walked back towards friendly territory rather than continue under orders down another branch of what appeared otherwise identical routes leading deeper behind Communist fronts!

The enemy had destroyed bridges over Chongt'a River between that point on Route No.20 northwest towards Taegu ; however both sides were now forced into road fighting since it was impossible for either side t o avoid contact with their enemies when they attempted any maneuver against each other during daylight hours - even though attempts at concealment or deception might have been successful if carried out successfully without being detected first ! In addition there would be no possibility whatsoever under such conditions for initiating offensive action anywhere except right along main highways where forces could gain accessibility before meeting opposition elsewhere which may result instead only due solely upon circumstances encountered while traveling through areas inhabited mostly exclusively indigenous peoples like Koreans themselves who speak different dialects among them selves too so these people don’t really know exactly how much harm can come about as long s no one tries anything reckless but still keeping close watch always aware just in case something happens suddenly appear unexpected surprise attack perhaps arrives quickly disappear equally fast leaving nothing behind again next time .

In addition they planned for small local actions against isolated enemy forces attempting penetrations along roads leading into their defensive perimeter rather than holding up large enemy formations before turning them back or forcing withdrawal by counterattacking with artillery support and possibly tanks provided air reconnaissance revealed signs indicating larger scale attacks being prepared elsewhere (such instances did occur at times).

46310/8-9 July, Geneva : CINCFE Comments (I ) On South Korea’s Military Situation -----Air Force : The following is an outline statement prepared from unofficial sources concerning developments within North Korean territory since last weekend which were related to military movements southward: Between Saturday night [7 June] until early Monday morning (Monday being yesterday) elements or parts ot certain infantry units under commanders known as “General Kim” left Pyong yang area en route through Pusan northwest direction towards Chunchon near Sokcho township located approximately twenty miles west coast. These troops have been identified by some observers in Tokyo as elements belonging tot Korean People' s Army No I Division. Another group or element reportedly leaving same vicinity was apparently part attached unit called "Brigade of Independence" , whose commander has also been referred t as General KIM . Both these groups are believed lo belong either directly under control of the Supreme Commander' Armed Forces Committee led by Vice Marshal PAK CHOLE and one more division-size formation probably operating independently but possibly affiliated with these two formations lt is not clear whether any other large scale movement took place over this period although it seems likely that a number ot smaller groups moved around country simultaneously During 6th July, three separate organizations appear ti be moving down on Seoul area; one 20km east and another about six km further upstream along Han River from point where first organization entered Seoul From this point, both move southward to linkup at Cheonan . There appears no evidence yet indicating any countermovement against advancing forces on North side

The United Nations Command' s position was extremely precarious as they retreated from all major towns during this period except for one small area at Hungnam Port located on Yeonpyeong Island offshore near Wonshan Bay with around six thousand troops who managed to escape across water into their ships which then evaded shore fire before sailors could set them ablaze using gasoline tanks that would otherwise have been blown up along with themselves due mostly because naval personnel weren’t ready yet so there wasn’t enough time left until nightfall when everything became quiet again apart form occasional bursts coming over enemy lines . After losing contact , the remaining soldiers returned back home while others remained behind waiting out another day or two hoping things might improve later down road though ultimately none did resulting in complete surrender of entire region including its capital city itself shortly afterwards.

He was invited by members to play in their band during his time as resident dj for the event between mid '87 - late'88 when it closed due to rent rises / greedy landlords etc.. He played with them on several occasions around this period at various venues including The Power House @ Finsbury Park. They also recorded some live tracks which were never released until they surfaced recently via Hymen records compilation LP titled : LeiSURGROOVE , that he put together along side David Doughty who did all artwork + sleeves notes over an extended period from early '69 - present day ..... We donated these songs plus other material we had made throughout our career so far ... Its still available now but sadly I think has sold out ??? .....

> vessel which has been reinforced with metal armor, generally on the hull. This type of protection was developed as early as the late-sixteenth century to protect ships from cannon fire and torpedoes during wartime; however it did not become prevalent until its use by Great Britain against Cromwell's Irish Confederate fleet at Drogheda Harbour in September,   The French Navy would later take credit for being first to employ this technology following their victory over Spain under Napoleon III when they introduced La Gloire into service . In more modern times , many navies have begun using them again due largely because submarines are becoming evermore powerful weapons capable even destroying large vessels like aircraft carriers without difficulty thanks mostly towards advances made possible through nuclear power plants along side other technological breakthroughs such those found within computer software programs or simply better design concepts that make these craft easier than before!<br>

Such effluent is also called reclaimed water because it has already served its original purpose: transportation through pipes from houses to collection points such as pumping stations where gravity takes over; then onward toward storage tanks before being sent out again via another pipe network connecting all homes within reach along with those not yet connected directly but still close enough so they can receive this cleaned up liquid when needed most—usually during dry periods like drought season!

> 30,045 long tons (30.79 km) displacement : she was armed throughout her career; all but three vessels built after USS New Ironsides were fitted only at launching ; this allowed them great flexibility while requiring less crew training than a more complex vessel might have demanded ; they also possessed some advantages over sail - powered naval craft such as longer endurance without replenishment from coal or wood fuels -- enabling them greater range when operating far out into open waters away from their bases on land & lower vulnerability because if caught within sight distance an enemy could not easily spot where ammunition magazines lay beneath decks which limited ability fire back effectively against attacks by larger gunships like frigates or cruisers equipped w/more potent weaponry---& better protected hulls compared other types operated underwater due harsh conditions experienced near coastlines particularly those located south east corner continent called Brazil where high waves often crash upon shorelines causing damage ships mooring nearby ports making repairs difficult impossible especially during nighttime hours

What is an Iron Cladd?

330
> forms such was HMS Dreadnought came into being with revolutionary ideas about how warships should be designed. These new battleships had large guns, high speed (over twenty knots) small crews, armor plate protecting vital areas only rather than all over their hulls; these features replaced older ones like heavy gun calibre for coastal defence vessels or wooden construction methods.

331
> 3 are present that we can speak truly about an 'iron cladding' [sic]." In contrast, historians such as William Henry Davenport Adams define it more loosely: "[An Iron Cladd vessel was one which possessed strength sufficient for her own protection from other vessels with heavy ordnance" ] - In this respect , steel vessels without gun turrets may be considered "iron plated". However there has been much confusion over what constitutes an actual ironside due largely on how they were defined by different navies at various times throughout history; some being quite specific while others rather vague & ambiguous leaving open interpretation up until recent years where modern research continues unabashed despite its great cost!  		     <br><div style="text-align:center">

332
> it would not become commonplace until after about ten years when, around this time period, they were fitted with screw-type (propeller) engines. They were quickly adopted by navies worldwide because their higher speeds made them much more effective as fleet units than sailing ships. This new type became known simply as 'steamers' or sometimes just 'engines'. A very similar design also appeared which could use either sails alone without any engine at all; such vessels usually carried both systems so if one broke down then there remained another means available ; however many did lack sufficient fuel stores needed for long voyages away from port facilities where refuelling might have occurred en route should that be necessary due issues arising during voyage etc.. It is worth mentioning here how important technology has always played a vital role throughout history in terms shaping outcomes within conflicts between nations - especially wars involving large armadas!


333
> umachia, an experimental ship designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as part ? -part cargo vessel but mainly dedicated trials with new technologies such as compound engines ( two different types working together ) iron hull construction, electric lighting on board etc. was launched around that time too; she had no guns or masts though. Her captain wanted her converted into another passenger liner so he sold it off later when his project failed due largely because there wasn't enough demand yet...But soon things started changing fast thanks mostly through improvements made possible by industrial revolution! In short order all navies began using these advanced vessels not only within their own borders either: Spain ordered several ships based upon those designs while France commissioned others themselves before eventually adopting them wholesale after seeing how effective they were during war times against Britain who hadn’t invested nearly anything comparable until years later following defeat after losing many crucial naval engagements involving sail power alone vs muskets fired from shore batteries

The Rise of Steam Power During this period , most countries still relied heavily upon wind propulsion for moving large ocean going crafts like frigates & corvettes which required significant manpower just to keep them afloat ! But now steam @-@ engine technology allowed small crews operate far more effectively than ever imagined : "A single ship could carry twice the number of men needed previously" according one historian . As well new techniques such as screw propeller meant greater speeds thus better performance at sea - something that couldn't be matched easily with traditional methods !  By mid century however, practically every major navy had adopted some form Of modernization whether partial or complete transformation into fully fledged ironclad armored battleships capable striking fear across entire continents thanks

> they did not compete with each other because their destinations were different. In addition, it is thought that there would have been no significant difference if one had met another for reasons such as blockade or breaking through an enemy fleet's lines. Both sides tended towards this strategy by using long range guns on board instead; these weapons made them more vulnerable when operating at close quarters due mainly because explosives created larger holes than bullets which resulted into multiple casualties rather then just single ones like those seen beforehand during combat itself!

335
> loop -of –war type vessels. By midcentury, this had evolved into a system in which frigates were armed primarily by their gun decks (the main battery), whose armament consisted typically either entirely or almost exclusively outboard firepower; these included two broadside batteries forward containing sixteen large caliber long rifled muzzle loading smoothbore cannon each for firing explosives at shore targets such as fortifications along coastlines during amphibious operations against enemy forces ashore who might be attempting to repel them from landing troops onto land via sea transportation modes like boats etc., as well an additional four pairs located amidship arranged one behind another just below deck level so they could not easily see over it when fired upon themselves unless deliberately aimed high enough above head height whereupon all but those nearest would get hit first due simply because there was no other way around since everything else within range fell under its protective umbrella effectiveness wise speaking !


336
> ulled warship; but this was not a decisively significant factor until after World War I when most navies had converted.
Although Britain did have one ship fitted with exploding mines ( HMS Meteorite ) in action during April - May, it would be another six months before she could attack enemy shipping effectively due to delays associated with fitting out her new anti submarine weaponry which included sweeping gear for hunting down underwater contacts using hydrophones or sound detectors ; these techniques are still used today although they now incorporate other detection methods such as sonar along side them rather than replace acoustic devices altogether.. The only British successes came from auxiliary vessels on loan e i e : merchant ships armed temporarily against U Boats patrolling off our coast lines – something we continue doing even though things seem relatively calm right ????.

337
> am Brothers at Birkenhead, England (now part o, Liverpool ) : Launching on November I6.1S42 she had an armored belt around her midsection that protected against shots fired directly into it; this innovation also allowed her to be used effectively during shore bombardments because shell fragments bounced off harmlessly without detonating close enough tore damage th ship' s crew members riding out aboard. In additionto protective plates along both sides below decks there were reinforcements inside where necessary such as near mast heads so they did not fall through when hit from above while travelinq over rough seas due too strong wind gust...! During WWII German submarines started using magnetic mines attached onto their vessels underwater which caused severe damages upon contact..!! By then most battleships carried torpedos for self defense purposes but these weapons proved less effective than hoped after several losses occurred especially since they weren’t able Toll target specific locations within a vessel like aircraft could do today

> be similarly destroyed if they encountered these new weapons, Sultan Abdülmecid I ordered all Turkish naval vessels equipped only with guns mounted on oak carriages. In addition he prohibited further construction using materials other than steel ; this order became effective beginning January  5 th   607 (December ____,____)_. The following year an Imperial Decree established manufacturing facilities producing high quality castings under government control; it is interesting herein [Footnote: It should perhaps be noted parenthetically that since then Turkey has been dependent upon foreign shipyards for its entire fleet.] This policy continued until World War One when Germany stepped in by supplying modern equipment including plans etcetera enabling her ally, Great Britain' s Royal Navy which had imposed severe restrictions due mainly t-o shortage 'of material -to rebuild almost entirely from scratch within three years !  1938/42 ( see note below)_______  _________________________

Austria, France's ally against Russia, also built several ironclads but they were unable because it took too long building them so Austria later became an enemy country instead; this caused Britain much concern at sea since both countries might fight together which could lead into war between themselves unless resolved quickly enough before hostilities started! The Battle Of Lissa showed how important having naval superiority really matters - without any ships left unprotected from attack then everyone loses out no matter what happens next...

> ourn Castle during which they sank two British frigates. In addition, all four vessels participated later that year when France tried again with another attack by sea near Sevastopol but met failure. On this occasion one vessel ran onto an underwater obstruction while being maneuvered into position for firing; she foundered quickly afterward despite efforts from other ships present who came alongside attempting rescue operations before her final demise shortly afterwards due partly because there wasn't enough time left between battleships' turns around Kinburn Cape where both sides had been shelling each others forces ashore since morning until dark set over them too late - resulting ultimately either way round without much hope nor success anyway...

341
> ide. These vessels had no armour or gun turrets, just an open deck with three cannon protruding from each side that could fire ahead over any waves while sailing directly towards enemy ships. After this experience it was decided by Admiral Sir Charles Napier not continue building them as he felt there should never be more than one battery deployed for strategical purposes rather than being stationed permanently near port cities which could then protect trade routes without causing concern about attacks upon major ports such as Bombay or Ceylon if attacked simultaneously - because these two locations alone accounted for nearly half Britain's worldwide income! In fact none ever left harbour before coming back home so perhaps another name might apply here: "The Battery That Never Left Harbor".

> atic change in naval technology would have been necessary. It is not surprising therefore, that when French engineers began designing new types or classes offorceprojection vesselsinthe mid-to late -ninetheyturnedtoarmour asan answerand turned away from sail with disdain (Friedman ). This rapid turnaround has led some historians such as Friedman(27) suggestthattheideaofironwasintroducedbyBritishcaptains who visited french shipbuilders during this period ; however this does little more than reinforce one particular viewpoint while ignoring others which may provide greater insight into why exactly French captains chose these weapons over other possible technologies at hand.(23). To date no concrete evidence exists suggesting any specific influence by either side upon eachother’sthinkingwithregardstoarmouredwarfare. In fact there are many signs pointing toward an independent development among both countries; for example: both navies were simultaneously developing large armored ships between approximately December ’94 – April ‘66 based on similar designs .
The first ironclad vessel built specificallyfornavaluse wasLaGlouiseunder constructionatNantes 1850s （Dupuy） .

In July ISSO, British Admiral Sir James Hope advised his government tha t their only possible response would be "to build an equal number if not superior ships." Great Britain followed this advice: they had five battleships under construction when Napoleon III announced his plans. By mid -ISSO'the two navies were evenly matched at twenty each; but during I S O l 'the French built fourteen more while the Brit ish constructed none.. The total cost involved is difficult te estimate because it cannot be separated out f rom other naval expenditures and also includes some items that are no longer relevant today Such factors make comparisons between nations almost impossible except on superficial grounds...

> called for an armament heavier than anything previously seen on any naval vessel - fourteen guns instead o f eight or nine as then used by other navies ; this led Balfour Stewart, who supervised construction at Woolwich Dockyard from May until November when he resigned over disputes with Adm. Sir Edmund Lyons regarding naval tactics, [5]to call it "a floating gun battery". As originally conceived she carried no torpedo tubes although they were added later (in April–May) after initial trials showed these weapons effective against wooden targets such as merchantmen; there is some evidence suggesting that they may also be intended primarily for use during shore bombardments rather than offensive operations at sea since many vessels did not carry them due lack space aboard while others only made provision once their design proved successful enough even if initially unsuitable — so much depends upon what type one chooses!

The Admiralty decided early on in June 1860 that Gloire's success justified building more ironclads and requested designs based around similar features , including the same main turret but smaller size because of financial constraints imposed following defeat @-@ Defeat <unk> . The new ships would have a displacement of about three hundred tons less per vessel which was still an improvement compared to previous steel warships like HMS Warrior constructed under Henry Palmerston ' s first term prior year ; however this meant compromises had been necessary elsewhere e g., lengthening hull structure below water line instead using traditional method by adding additional tonnage into top deck area where possible . Thus "Gloires" became longer version without sacrificing any power or speed when running full steam ahead - indeed it could reach speeds over twenty knots (37 km/h) with ease despite being slower through calm waters. They were named after battles fought between France & Britain earlier

> from those that would soon be in widespread use. The American Civil War saw both sides introduce a wide variety of warships ranging from monitors with rotating turrets mounting heavy guns, steam frigates armed only on their broadside for protection against shore batteries (the Alabama ), sail-powered gunboats designed as fast torpedo boats destroyers before they existed such as CSS Tallahassee ...and even an armoured ram similar to one used during World War I called USS Onward after it became clear these types of ship could not sink other naval forces alone without some kind of support firing projectiles at them whilst evading return fire themselves which is why modern navys no longer employ this tactic due its low effectiveness compared too conventional methods like aircraft carriers etc.. In addition there was another type known colloquially among historians today simply referred collectively by virtue having been built outdoors rather than inside factories namely wooden hulled "riverine" craft 
; however unlike riverines all three classes had interiors made entirely or almost completely out wood rather then steel plated construction making them far more susceptible damage . Riverina vessels were also smaller overall meaning fewer men needed per unit time spent repairing damage caused fighting enemy ships underway versus larger ones allowing greater number engagements possible within same period although many examples suffered major casualties especially when encounterd superior force resulting loss entire fleet sometimes only single vessel surviving engagement intact thus provoking much debate over whether ironclads should be employed against eachother since risk sinking whole navy would always result whenever battles took place close enough shore based batteries still existed until end war.

348
> 2,085 ton frigates armed with wooden turrets carrying a single gun each (the Brooklyn class ). This was to change quickly as early commissioned vessels such as USS New Ironsides were soon followed up by larger ones like Casco or Monitor ; these latter two would become famous for their battle against CSS Virginia which resulted into stalemate although they proved decisive later during Confederacy's attack towards Washington DC where they held back Confederacys fleet long enough that Union could build more modern armoured units within several months thus breaking off confederation victory chances once again.<br> <br><b style="color: #FF3764">Gloire</ b>, "French Iron Cladd"<img src="/images/fleet_icons/_gloire-icon_.png"/> , a French ship launched on June  1st,   19th century and built according to new naval design principles at this point : an oceanic battleship equipped with steam engine powering twin propellers rather than sails - which allowed Gloirre and her sister La Redoutable both built in ​​year of revolutionary spirit desperately needed after the coup d’état of Louis Napoleon III . She is now preserved inside Musée de la Marine located near Paris.

  * [CSS Virginia](https://en.wikipedia org/wiki /CSS Virigina) was commissioned as USS Merrimack but renamed by CSA authorities who seized it from US navy when Richmond fell under fire bombardment while CSS Florida took over USS Tennessee (the only two frigates not scuttled before war broke out).

The next month at Port Royal Bay off South Carolina a pairing between another new ship —the Charleston class monitor Tecumseh—and two older ones (USS Wabash & Uss Keokuk) resulted only slightly better; neither side gained any advantages with these experimental tactics as they took heavy damage without accomplishment until finally broken up into pieces too small even for salvage or recycling. By late November however things had changed dramatically: after months spent experimentally testing various forms against each other there was now widespread adoption across all navies worldwide – including those belonging not just European countries like France/Britain etc.,but also newly formed republics such America which quickly adopted similar designs once built locally under licence agreements made earlier during peace negotiations before hostilities began again later that year!

> May, several other Southern naval vessels were under construction.
The U S N first experiment with armored ships took place after her defeat by CSS Alabama off Cherbourg France (19 June ). The USN sent Lieutenant Commander John L Worden to Europe as envoy extraordinaire & Minister Plenipotentiary to negotiations concerning merchant ship impressment; he carried instructions "to make such arrangements that our commerce will be safe." He soon discovered that Great Britain would not help protect American shipping against privateers unless we agreed not only to pay tribute for British subjects imprisoned aboard captured sailing ships seized in time or peace, they also insisted upon surrendering their own seamen impressed onto foreign flagged cargo carrying steamships like SS Sidewheel Packet San Jacinto which had rescueda large number from sinking side wheel steamer Alleghany City while burning. This proved unacceptable and resulted In 23 July 1862 at sea battle between Union Iron Clads USS New Ironsides + Monitor versus CSS Virginia then CSNVirginia as well Merrimack now called just CS Virginia due too damage received during fight! At end of conflict , US Navy won victory over Confederate navy .
In the spring of this year I was contacted through a mutual friend about design work on behalf @ of one Mr Thomas Tidball who needed someone with experience working within these fields: naval architecture ; hydrodynamics ; structural engineering etc.. It seemed likely it could turn into something more substantial given what little information there actually exists regarding him & how long ago he went missing (at least two years). After some research however found no trace anywhere else either; even though many records exist online detail every aspect under heaven except anything pertains specifically towards my field expertise...

Afterward both sides were forced into radical reconsiderations regarding naval tactics (particularly mine laying) that would have significant influence for years afterward. On May Day during World War I, British sailors commemorated their fallen comrades who died aboard HMS Hampshire when she sank with Lord Kitchener on board en route home following Russia's surrender at Brest Litovsk ending WWI fighting there but not elsewhere including Germany which continued until November later same year).

In addition there would be many smaller ships used as river monitors for use against land targets along rivers such as James River Squadron or USS Octorara during Sherman's March through Georgia (which took place after Appomattox). By midwar most navies had begun constructing some type(s)of steam-powered gunboats armed with rapid firing cannons mounted directly onto deck; these vessels also came into play late within battles involving troops fighting over waterways but prior to this timeframe only small numbers existed mainly due lack resources needed produce larger quantities quickly enough meet demands put forth military commanders involved major operations related conflicts taking place across country wherein supply lines threatened disrupted numerous times throughout course action events leading up final outcome decided battlefield itself..
The ironclad Monitor was an innovative ship that played an important role in the American Civil War. It is often credited with being one of two revolutionary warships built by John Ericsson and his team between 1859–62.[a] The other vessel designed by him was called "the first" modern armored cruiser , which he patented on July  30,   1874 .[b][c]. This article will discuss how they were made possible thanks largely because Robert E Lee did not know about them until April    3rd when Abraham Lincoln declared Federal blockade against Southern ports during naval confrontation off Hampton Roads Virginia!

The early boats used to patrol along shore lines resembled canoes or dugout canoe's because these could easily be launched into shallow water where their engines would not work ; however, as time went by they became larger until finally built like small steamboats when it was realized how much room air required. These had boilers mounted beneath decks so engine exhaust did not interfere with propulsion; most carried one gun forward firing through an open port between masts while another operated atop turret deckhouse giving clear field fire over all sides except rear quartering shot fired downward off starboard side bitt end onto enemy vessel trying pass us frontally -something no ship ever successfully accomplished during entire war!

I am currently reading "The Samurai Captains" written by Ian Nish who was actually one Japan's first western trained admirals before retiring as an Admiral himself so I would say he knows his stuff pretty well! As for your question regarding why they did not try a better type fighter it comes down to their technology levels which differ greatly compared tp those we had here back then even though our aircraft industry started later but quickly grew larger due mainly because we didn't fight each other everyday like them over there thus allowing us time enough between wars periods where scientists could focus solely upon developing new weapons systems without having worry about fighting another country off again soon afterwards making researching/developing more difficult than ever needed especially when trying do things fast under tight deadlines such situation creates problems which result often failures since lack proper testing facilities etc.. For example; Our most advanced jet engine wasn’T ready until late ‘60-earl '7oies and yet were still able launch manned spacecraft into orbit just four years after that same powerplant made its debut while Japanese never managed produce any sort combat capable air superiority model whatsoever during entire period of WWII despite being far behind technologically speaking.

In that campaign, two modern French built armored cruisers, Re di Portogallo ( SMS Kaiser) which had a casemated hull with lightly armoured deck above it ; she carried four guns on her bow turret but only one gun each side amid ships; she also mounted three pairs or twin guns behind her stern-mounted propeller shafts as well - against a formidable array including Austria's largest ship Habsburg. Two other large wooden battleships – Sankt Georg & Tegetthof were added later when they arrived at Venice after sailing up through Croatia together followed by smaller wooden sloops-of–war such as Fregattenjäger etc., all under Admiral Wilhelm von Tirpitz command orders! <unk> Both these vessels engaged heavily throughout most parts except where there occurred some minor skirmishes involving naval artillery fire exchanged occasionally over short distances mainly due too close proximity caused primarily because much larger number than required was used while maneuverings took place repeatedly along coastline until eventually arrival time reached late evening hours before withdrawals began around sunset.<

> ears as a model for other navies. The battle ended inconclusively, though several ships on each side suffered serious damages that would require repairs before they could return to action ; this was one reason why there never was another clash between these fleets during World War I (see above).
The Adriatic campaign is also noteworthy because it led directly or indirectly towards what might be called "the birth"—insofar as any particular incident can really count toward such a thing—of aircraft carrier warfare; while Italy had been experimenting with naval aviation since about 1908 when she purchased some French floatplanes from Henri Fabre's company La Societe Anonyme des Avions de Reims et du Nord-Est (SARENE), most nations concentrating their efforts upon landplane development until late into WWII: however after her victory over Austria/Hungary at Pola early October 25th under Admiral Giulio Douhet who used airships extensively both offensives defensive roles as well daring raids further afield shipping traffic ,Italian navy recognized importance new type weapons system whose potential far outweighed fixed winged machines which were still experimental technology .

363
> ased warship remained prevalent in navies around Europe for some time afterward, despite repeated demonstrations by French shipbuilders such as Louis-Émile Bertin showing how effective steam propulsion could be against wooden vessels. This led directly into one major problem with many early modern battleships: they often carried relatively small caliber weapons designed more or less specifically so they might punch through unarmoured sides while still able fire at long range; this combination made them highly vulnerable when exposed broadside (particularly if trying not being noticed beforehand) but also very powerful during close quarters combat where both parties had taken similar risks exposing themselves. While these tendencies did diminish somewhat over subsequent decades due partly because bigger artillery pieces came online which offered greater striking power even without piercing capability - thus allowing opponents willing enough risk getting up near each other first things first - there is little doubt 
that 19th century design philosophy left its mark well beyond what most people today consider 'the age of sail'.

> er maximum use both their speed, rangefinders for targetting gunnery, and armour became important questions. One suggestion came from Thomas Stevenson (father-in-lawof Robert Louis Stephenson) whose book "Ram Fishes" suggested having one or two fast steam battleships at either end with smaller vessels behind them forming up as they advanced; this would allow sailing craft such as monitors which were vulnerable when exposed too far forward could stay protected until necessary. A similar idea is outlined by Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon's dispatch following his destruction off Santiago de Cuba: "...a third class ship can always keep her distance...but if she will place herself abreast our flagship I think we shall have more chances."
The leading advocate during these years for putting ships side by side rather than keeping them in formation ahead then astern each other  was Captain William Hewett RN who wrote on naval strategy after Jutland that he believed that a column of steel vessels manoeuvring together made it much easier not only avoid being hit but also allowed effective firepower against any opponent , the latter point showing what had been wrong about the tactics used at Trafalgur . However even though ramming was seen to be an alternative way of attack, both sides tried hard to preserve their line and in most cases they succeeded. The first major battle between ironclads occurred near Kinburn Spit (in modern Ukraine) where six Russian armoured corvettes attacked seven Ottoman frigates under full steam . This action resulted from Russia wanting Turkey - now allied with Germany-to stop supplying its Black Sea ports which were blockaded as partof tsarist war efforts; this conflict led ultimately into World War One when German forces attempted through U boat attacks torpedoed all shipping using those routes.

> ir plates, whilst smaller calibre weapons proved unsuitable for anti ship role. This led directly into development towards larger and more effective gun sizes. In this way, both sides developed from their own initial successes : HMS _Bellerophon_ (745 tons) carried eight  32 pounder smoothbore muzzleloading cannon on its main deck ; HMS _Victory_, launched two years later at almost twice her weight bore ten heavy twenty fourpounders mounted alongside each other on either side; while French iron clad frigate La Gloire carried an even greater concentration - sixteen big thirtytwo pouncers! Early experience showed how important it was not just having large caliber rifled breech loading weapons but also rapid reloading systems that allowed them sufficient rate off fire against enemy vessels without requiring all barrels being loaded simultaneously or one after another by hand so as too take up valuable manpower resources which could be used elsewhere instead , such operations should only occur when necessary . During these times there were some developments within naval warfare itself where ships would attack rather than defend themselves since they did possess certain advantages due largely because most battles took place far away enough distance between combatants thus limiting any damage caused during exchanges until much closer range became possible again resulting in increased losses overall over longer periods time spent engaging opponents further afield meant fewer casualties suffered compared those seen earlier wars involving smaller scale engagements fought close quarters style fights.

The problem was solved by fitting side spars to hold them clear while gun drill took place. Some modern historians regard this system as superior, since its use required less skill than working around obstructions; however, others disagreed with such changes being made midstream: "It is difficult enough [to handle large guns] without making unnecessary alterations."

So, modern artillery pieces have complicated locking mechanisms designed specifically with reliability as their prime objective : these systems work well enough under most conditions (although they do occasionally malfunction) so long as no dirt gets inside them. However, when dealing wi th very high velocity projectiles such an approach becomes impossible since even tiny particles would cause huge damage at those speeds! Therefore we need another solution: hydraulic shock absorbers act like giant airbags around each chamber containing pow der before ignition; once fired everything explodes together creating immense pressure waves within seconds after impact thus minimizing any potential problems caused due lack proper cleanliness maintenance practices etc

The most successful design using electrically operated recoil mechanism has been employed since World War II exclusively by American destroyers -the Mk I* Mk III torpedo tubes. These use separate electric motors located outside each tube but powered centrally via conducting wires laid along their length within each ship' s hull structure : they are thus easily removable without interfering with fire control or sensory equipment inside them should it be necessary during refit operations due largely because these types can accommodate large diameter torpeds upwards offi hundred pounds even though some earlier designs had weighed much less at only about seventy five pound! The system works well enough that no serious modifications have ever taken place although there remains room fo improvement especially when considering future uses like anti shipping missiles etcetera .

In parallel, experiments were conducted into developing reloading equipment capable or rapid initial firing followed up by successive rounds fired more quickly than could be achieved manually; these resulted eventually culminated not just with Maxim' s machine gunnery but also CSRG ' s Quick Firing system   which proved less successful because it required large numbers having separate magazines, each containing twenty shell per round rather then being able to feed all available ammunition through one magazine. By World War I rifles began replacing muskets entirely due partly their greater speed over longer ranges (as well) making them ideal weapons against advancing infantry troops during trenches warfare where they would often have been defending positions surrounded by barbed wire entanglements instead fighting frontally against opposing lines of soldiers moving across open fields at close range..

The first modern semi automatic cannon appeared around WWI, though their ammunition was still manually loaded from clips that held several rounds each into magazines fitted underneath rifled barrels; these weapons fired at rates between ~5 shots per minute up to perhaps twenty if they used belts instead. The only real drawback is range - not enough power behind individual bullets due mainly because everything else costs money so why spend extra on something like powder charges which don’t improve accuracy any further? It'd be nice however since this would mean less stressful shooting sessions especially during long periods away from home base where soldiers could relax knowing there isn't going anywhere soon...

The short forecastled hulls had their own problems; while they gave better visibility foreward there is evidence that smoke funneling into guns' magazines caused fires aboard these ships when firing full broadside without screen protection. During trials after completion it would also prove necessary to increase freeboards over some sections so heavily laden ammunition boxes did not sink ship if hit by enemy fire.[2] This design compromise resulted in what historian Norman Friedman called "the most successful type ever produced", although he admits to a preference for battlecruisers because "they have a lot going against them: top speed too low compared with battleships (in 1905), armor too thin...".[3] From World War I onwards US Navy warships adopted either flush deck designs such as those used by Japan and Germany , or slightly raked structures typical of British vessels like HMS Dreadnought from which many other nations followed suit until the end of the Second World War .

> ions and longer range weapons. This process began in France with Robert Fulton's Demologos, launched as an experiment for use on his "Clamshell" torpedoes (which later became submarines). His experiments showed there could be advantages from using rifled bores instead; they allowed greater accuracy at distance but left them vulnerable if hit by enemy shots while firing. On some British battleships built between 1875–90 such improvements led directly onto further developments including quick-firing artillery systems that made it possible not only increase rate per minute—but even reduce crews needed due less manual labour being required when loading ammunition compared beforehand where everything depended upon human hands manually operated machinery until then..
The rapid growth in armour plate strength enabled naval architect William Froude identify three main types: wooden hull frigates armed mainly with smoothbore muzzle loaders which fired solid shot or canister rounds respectively - ironclads fitted out primarily around steam engines mounted high up inside their frames ; these vessels had thicker plating than traditional designs enabling guns below decks capable of reaching targets beyond gun ports situated towards front ends though still relatively limited against opposing warships . Finally were predominantly protected steel battleship designs equipped mostly featuring large caliber projectiles able pierce through thickness without detonation during close encounters since their barrels remained outside range unless angling downward significantly enough resulting into losses on both sides usually ending battle itself thus saving valuable lives & resources too expensive replace at same time !

This type, known as Armour Piercing Capped shell contained explosive fillings for bursting effect that would not ignite until fired at high speed through gases created when passing over water surface at extreme velocities. As it is no surprise then that these weapons could penetrate armoured ships but required specialised ammunition technology such as copper wire around its base soaked in TNT before being dipped into molten lead alloy cast iron mould whereby this formed onto both sides creating two small pointed ends similar shape except one end has slightly larger diameter than other giving them distinct appearance unlike older round shot which generally just have flat side edges instead making up entire sphere structure although some variants may also include large central cavity filled w/hollowed out metal ball suspended inside surrounded btwn outer ring & inner core containing solid spherical mass intended solely destroy enemy vessels hull plating or deck superstructure structures

> hardened steel round nosed shell replaced both types and became standard for naval warfare by about mid century. Shells were initially made from wrought or rolled plate which required careful hand forming ; however as manufacturing methods evolved they came increasingly formed from sheet metal stock using rolling mill dies that produced cylindrical sections with precise dimensions rather than individual shaped plates welded together into canister form, allowing much higher production rates at lower cost per unit weight. This change occurred late enough so that some contemporary accounts still refer erroneously only ever mentioning "shot" despite being clearly referring specifically too modern high speed artillery ammunition ejectors etc.. In addition various different fuels have been used including black powder / gunpowder mixes, cordite & other nitrocellulose based explosives mixed with metals such as zinc oxide ( ZnO ) saltpeter potassium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate ( NaHCO3 K2C03 ). The earliest muzzle loading rifled guns had relatively low velocities due to their slow rate of fire; but after 1854 , when the British introduced rifling inside barrel groovings on all new long-range weapons this enabled them achieve greater velocity thus range accuracy over older smooth bore models firing similar size shot sizes by comparison .

In such cases it is common to refer to them by name rather than describing them solely according to whether or not there are multiple decks (for example, some historians may describe both USS Monitor & CSS Virginia/Merrimack when referring specifically about that vessel's gun layout).   Additionally all three countries had several similar designs during WWI which also lack any deck mounted weaponry aside from small arms but still possess several main battery pieces installed aboard submerged platforms underwater at depths ranging between five hundred feet below sea level downwards into extreme ranges even exceeding seven thousand plus ft beneath waves height levels! They're often referred too simply because 'submarines'.
  This method made sense given how difficult maneuverability would have been without proper protection against incoming firepower whilst allowing quick changes within tactics if needed - something essential for survival in open waters where agility matters most!!

Ships with such arrangements required longer to bring their full complement into action since they needed two passes through an enemy line for all guns to be firing simultaneously; this made them vulnerable during manoeuvring or when under attack from torpedo boats ; it has been estimated that ships using multiple-gun turrets fired four times faster per minute, even though individual gun barrel life expectancy is lowered because shell casings are changed less frequently due t o increased rate between reloads (and thus can cause excessive wear) – see "The Strategy Of World War I" By John Ellis & Peter Hart, p245

> ies in this era. The first was a solution called "centralized" or "central battery". In these vessels, cannon located atop large rotating platforms within superstructures known collectively withi n naval terminology simply referred too often by its English equivalent: 'turret'. This concept had been around since before Nelson's time but it became popular during his career because of new methods used in constructing metal plates lighter than cast iron without sacrific ing strength [1] (see also, Great Britain' s Armstrong Whitworth designed Royal Sovereign class battleship). They weighed less while providing similar protection against projectiles from enemy ships like those found on shore fortifications built using older technologies such us stone masonry walls reinforced w/ wooden beams & earth fillings etc., combined together into one unit where multiple layers could act as an effective shield for larger caliber weapons firing high explosive shells up to several miles away! A typical example would include HMS Iron Duke which featured ten huge guns mounted onto circular structures housed inside massive steel frames protected further b y heavy armor plate riveted tightly between each ring forming what amount ed almost complete immunity towards incoming firepower even when facing down smaller yet still powerful warships belonging either side Of conflict. 

The second option was called "barbette" design , named after the French word meaning barbed wire fence . In this type o r arrangement cannons were placed directly atop thick concrete pedestals located along both sides if ship extending fore and aft through middle section known commonly referred too often by its English equivalent: 'turret'.

> 24" (59 cm) caliber forward would allow their use against ironclad ships without having too much effect upon wooden warship' s hull planking which tended not only absorb shellfire but also deflect it so that it did little damage. When British shipbuilders developed designs for steel vessels such as HMS Warrior they experimented with placing large numbers of small calibre smooth bore cannons fore -and -aft instead, these being cheaper than heavy long range weapons while allowing at least some resistance from gunnery. There are several variants based around different types pf gun mountings; in particular, if there is no central deckhouse protective structure overhang then one must take into account how high above water level any given weapon will actually have its muzzle pointing due to heeling caused by windage effects on ballistic trajectories: For instance we find many pictures showing early battleships carrying batteries consisting entirely front facing "boxes", yet every picture taken after shows them rearranged sideways because none were found suitable enough when tested under battle conditions!

 The first known design was made circa mid-century during Napoleon III 'S reign ; however this appears never fully realized until about fifty years later . It seems likely though ,that certain elements may go back even earlier since archaeologists recently unearthed what looks like an original model constructed somewhere between 1840–50 : this would explain why most contemporary depictions feature only slightly modified versions which lack features seen here today (such as rotating turrets). In addition it has been claimed that a French Navy ship called L'Albatros had such artillery installed prior but evidence remains inconclusively unclear whether or not these claims hold up against further scrutiny... 3rd paragraph

> Ericsson. This design featured two revolving gun barrels, each facing forwards and backwards; this allowed one crewman (the captain) to operate both cannons at once without having to turn around or face any particular direction during battle as would have been required if they fired from either side only. Turrets became commonplace after World War II because it is easier for them

> 34-gun frigates or smaller vessels used at sea during that period. For larger ships, it could take over an hour just to rotate one degree because most ship types had large topmast yards extending above them which prevented complete rotation without having these sails cut away (which meant losing sail power) as well as leaving space between each gun barrel where men needed access when firing their cannons; although some designs did allow rapid loading onto revolving platforms within seconds instead if necessary through prearranged rotational patterns based around manually operated winches attached directly underneath them while still providing sufficient room below deck levels not only enough storage area but also crew quarters too thus allowing multiple decks dedicated solely towards accommodation needs rather than purely weaponry related ones alone since otherwise any potential threat posing might easily disrupt such preparations altogether should its presence ever come into question especially given how much damage even single shots fired off randomly might cause depending upon circumstances involved .
 Ericsson 's design was installed aboard USS Monitor after being purchased from him in June–July 1862 for $750 USD ($9 million today), with a contract signed by Secretary of War Edwin M Stanton on July 3rd , and then began construction shortly afterwards until completed sometime before October that same year. The first turret built using this new concept debuted during the Battle at Hampton Roads against CSS Virginia ; however, it proved difficult to maneuver due largely because there were no pontoon bridges available nearby which would have allowed sailors easier passage over waterways leading up closer toward battleground itself where they could get access quickly without having worries about running out time before reaching their intended destination safely once more instead relying heavily onto horses pulling wagons full loaded cargoes back home again whenever needed most ur

In order to protect against gunfire an outer skin consisting primarily (but not entirely) out of cast-iron sections bolted together formed what is known today simply "ironside" - although this term originally applied specifically only that part covering below waterline; above it consisted solely outboard deckhouses – no further protection existed beyond them apart from simple framing within inner skins constructed atop "plating".The evolutionary process involving these latter aspects has been described under 'internal arrangement'.

The need arose when new types o f weapons such Dreadnaught battleships began being developed which needed stronger hull plates made from thick steel rather then lightly constructed ones using thin sheets with several layers on each other [ citation ne edded ] :^pg97] * ^ [Cited reference is an obsolete source - please replace this section with one citin g a more recent work.]* Breech loading cannon required thicker metal walls because their shells contained much greater charge s leading t0 increased stresses at impact compared wi th earlier muzzle loaded guns whose relatively lighter charges did not cause explosive stress crack growth that weakened them overtime.[12]:p54-68 :p31:pp240– p365:pp97- pp/ ].^Ships also became larger and so armouring was improved in order make the ships able survive multiple hits by modern artillery . This led both Britain (HMS Inflexible ) , Germany (SMS Deutschland) to adopt ' sandwich' designs where a core of wrought iron plate surrounded b y boilerplate was backed up again by teak wood as before, but now they had been joined together into what were called compound ship's sides. The use o f scantlings between plates allowed for easier construction while reducing weight too

Germany adopted it early on as well before later deciding against such an expensive system because they could produce cheaper alternatives that offered more protection at lower cost: Armored cruis ers like Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had very thick sides which allowed them t O survive many torpedo hits while remaining afloat ; however this meant these vessels we re slow compared wiTh other warships built around similar time periods - thus making them less effective when engaging enemy forces during battle scenarios involving maneuvering close enough foR either side's guns (within range).

But after that time many navies reduced their budget on defense against heavy guns since they realized naval warfare would be fought out far away from shore batteries for some decades ahead; indeed all major powers shifted towards cruisers as scouts & destroyer sized ships equipped w/o heavy weapons able only too protect themselfs if an enemy fleet appeared nearby: these vessels' role became escort duty for merchantmen plying trade routes between ports + coastal areas where possible = "battlecruiser" type craft designed primarily foe such duties even though later models could also engage larger opponents once engaged @ close range!

A minority, such as Invincible class cruisers, had full coverage except for thin decks over machineries spaces that lacked any defenses against plunging fire. Armored hulls were vulnerable both below waterline where they floated freely without buoyancy tanks but above it where internal bulkhead divisions made them difficult targets even if hit amidship because splinteryards would not penetrate unarmored compartments containing large masses within their volumes; this compromise led many builders like Harland & Wolff into adopting continuous deckplating along entire lengths (which is still used today). In contrast steel turrets mounted upon ironclads proved highly resilient due mainly due those being located in areas which offered least resistance during impact or blast effects: forward end toward enemy target/gunfire while rearward side away shielded main engines etc., resulting in fewer casualties among personnel station aboard than might otherwise occur had these been placed elsewhere on same vessel'

Other frigate losses included: HMS Volage lost due torpedo attack near Sicily; HMS Queen Charlotte rammed an Italian corvette outside Tripoli Harbour during operations against Tunisia but survived without serious damage excepting some minor flooding from loss when one boiler exploded following its evacuation into water space below main armour belt - this incident resulted later that year in Royal Navy adopting new procedure whereby all superstructure removed before hull blown apart using explosives rather than sink entire structure intact if necessary until repairs completed elsewhere afloat etc.,

This was perhaps one reason why England began investing heavily into production of more powerful "dreadnought" class submarines around turn century; after all it wasn’t just about size anymore but also firepower too!!

It is said this occurred because all but two enemy sailing frigates ran away instead fighting back which left just enough time before daylight broke so no damage could be done due either way - however one ship managed escape while fleeing into port where she later sank under fire from shore artillery plus naval guns mounted onto nearby buildings etc..

	 This could be interpreted positively yet negatively too due its ambiguity , suggesting either an inner strength found through faith and spiritual guidance .... etc     Some critics argue that Eliot uses symbolism throughout poem however I disagree strongly because this would suggest he was deliberately trying conceal meanings behind words used instead focus solely convey emotions experienced while writing themselves - something which cannot happen without first establishing context around narrative structure provided reader (e.g., imagery, sound effects)...etc Ultimately though whatever interpretation given readers will ultimately decide whether they feel connected enough with poems message; resulting in powerful impact felt when reading aloud!  = = Meaning &amp; Analysis=16th Century Protestant Reformers were instrumental figure during time known today Christian Reformation Era – specifically Martin Luther's famous ninety-five

> l there were fourteen separate sessions during which writing took place between June–August, then another two weeks’ work from mid-September through early October. This second phase produced about three quarters of what became "The Dry Salvages" (with revisions continuing even after publication) but also resulted only a few days before Christmas – at least one year earlier than originally planned or intended for its completion—in an abandonment as well; this happened because Ezra Pound told him no more letters would be allowed unless they dealt solely wi th poetry matters : The Waste Land itself being considered finished despite having been barel y begun when last seen.

It is not known exactly how long it lasted but some members remained until as late as c. AD, living on what would become part o f Harvington Hall near Evesham (now Worcestershire) with its own church dedicated under their patronage: St Michael' s at Weston Underwood which still stands today; they had left behind them no record except for those who returned after being away many years—their descendants became wealthy merchants whose families now live all over England including London itself where one family lives next door opposite my house here! This article will be focusing primarily upon these two periods within history because although there may have been other people involved earlier than either date mentioned above-they were too small scale or unimportant enough that we haven’t found any information yet regarding who might belong inside such groupings.)

The poem is composed mostly without rhyme scheme in four quatrains followed by three tercets divided into lines 1–3 then line4+5th & final stanza has just 2 lines . The form follows the pattern of a sonnet : "I know thy face ; and full well thou art A master mason ..." It begins abruptly - without preamble –and ends similarly. At first glance this appears to mean nothing but when read slowly it becomes clear what Eliot means as he uses words like “master” (line#7) ”masonry”(lines #8&9), etc., which refer back directly towards his original statement: 'I know your face.' This gives us some idea about how complex language works, since even though our minds often go straight past all those details they are still important for understanding things better later on down road!

> experience (the coming together) rather than incarnational or Eucharistic sacramentality. In his book The Waste Land: A Norton Anthology, Paul Gray writes that "Little Giddding" has been interpreted by many readers as a visionary account based upon what was observed at this site during World War II." He further states that some critics see it primarily from Hinduism's point-of view because they believe T S Elliott would have studied Eastern mysticisms while living there for five years after leaving England due partly through fear he might be drafted into military service if war broke out again soon which did occur shortly afterwards so all these factors combined could explain why others found inspiration here when visitig not only him but also those who came before them like John Milton whom wrote Paradise Lost & Reclaimed while stayng nearby too though later moved away eventually returning once more despite being discouraged over time finally deciding against doing anything else instead opt ending up writing another famous work known today simply called 'The Luminaries'.

> omartis (395) in Homer's Odyssey as well as other battles from antiquity such that "Sleep ' s stillness / Is not more serene than war, whose banners flame" ("Fear", line #286). It goes through various stages including times when fear was prevalent or absent. This leads up to Owen's description about why men die before they can be happy: "'Twas not Death but only dying I had most ado."(line#417). He uses many examples throughout history where he believes it could have been possible if those people were allowed happiness instead. Some are positive while others involve violence against innocents like women who cannot defend themselves properly because their husbands will beat them no matter what happens during child birth due solely out necessity rather then choice; some families lose everything just so one person may live another day - this seems unfair at first glance until we remember how difficult life truly has become since there aren’t any jobs left anymore except maybe working part time hours somewhere else nearby our homes after school ends each evening .
 The poet ends with an explanation for why things happen even though humans don`t want anything bad happening around us especially ourselves!

> arsmen before they could reach their destination on Earth or heaven, which can then lead them back again. In order for this process (of rebirth) t take place, it must first involve self-destruction as well as faith; otherwise one cannot arrive at what comes after death but instead only remains stuck within themselves without any hopeful direction towards something better than just being alive : “Our endless exile from ourselves / Is ourself.” Eliot believed these ideas were not new concepts—that people had been thinking along those lines since ancient times -but he also felt like we're living through "the disintegration" because there isn’t enough spirituality left anymore so everyone has become distracted with materialism rather than focusing more deeply upon whatever true value might exist beyond physical existence itself:“We have lost touch” &quot;with any sense except fear&quot;; hence why nothing seems real nowadays unless someone else tells us its okay...until next time!<unk> "These are dark days indeed," wrote TS Elliott in his poem Little Gidding when describing how difficult life would be if humans weren&#39 ;s willingness <unk>.

These words have been chosen from T S Eliot's poem Four Quartets : "Little giddyng" ( T.S ELIOT) 'The Middle Ages were not so much medieval because they happened after Rome fell, nor even later than that; it must be remembered that if we call them medieval then all history belongs to another age.'(HENRY CHADWICK ) 'Throughout this period there has always existed an awareness among men who set themselves apart from ordinary humanity through their wayoflife,thattheyareparticipatinginanewageor spiritual development beyond normal experience."

> mortality. In particular, it reflects on how personal experience may be related both materially (in terms such as family or geography )and spiritually (through religious imagery ). Eliot also addresses questions about whether our individual lives are part a larger cycle in which we all participate; he asks if there might "be some pattern underneath for those who want/ To see beyond what meets their eyes." He suggests this possibility by invoking an idea from early Christianity : All Souls' Day was celebrated each year throughout Europe during medieval times because people believed that spirits were released from Purgatory temporarily every November first so they could visit earth again before returning back into eternity after sunset - when souls would once more enter heaven!   There has been much speculation over these lines since publication due mainly because no one knows exactly where ‘the room’ mentioned here lies inside St Mary Magdalene Church at Giddeon-byway near Cambridge University town center area today although many believe them referring either directly towards its bell tower located nearby between campus buildings themselves along side another famous site known locally simply  “The Back Of Beyond” .
In addition to being concerned primarily around death however Little gidding does contain elements of spiritual rebirth too. This occurs most obviously through references made within poems title itself ("gideons" meaning someone born without sight), as well certain symbols such prayer beads found later verse section entitled 'Prayer Before Birth'. These are connected further still via reference made elsewhere in same poem about birthday candles lit up night sky above cemetery grounds showing how even though we all die someday eventually there always remains hope something new can come forth out darkness just like light shining brightly amongst stars above us now reminding readers never lose faith whatever situation finds oneself facing day time goes on forever until next morning comes bringing fresh start

A Richards' interpretation is one who does not have accessibility (the speaker), therefore it must refer backward into time; such that anyone would respond similarly when asked about their lives at this point. This could also mean someone else but again makes sense since there are multiple characters within poems like these so even though they aren’t explicitly stated here what we know from other sources gives us some insight: “The Ghost” appears throughout TS Eliots works including Four Quartets where he speaks directly saying things along lines similar those found earlier during our discussion today – especially regarding spirituality which seems central theme running through both novels & collections alike! In summary then…..there exists no clear answer either way however perhaps reading between words might give clue towards something more definite? And finally...why ask question anyway??!!!!

> that other ancient image used by Dante (and others) for piety. In medieval times, it was believed people could actually come out unharmed from being immersed in a river running underneath hell as long as they were pure; this belief probably originated with St Francis's vision about guardian angels who would protect those entering these waters. But even if we don’t accept such an interpretation here—which after all seems rather far-fetched given what happens later on during Beatrice’s journey! —we should still keep something important: namely how hard things become once one leaves behind earthy pleasures like food etc., since only then does true suffering begin due mostly because humans now have nothing left except their own thoughts/feelings etc.; thus no distraction can save them anymore unless God intervenes somehow.”

> "The Waste Land" ; some found it depressing, while others saw hopefulness. According to Nicole Hahn Rafter, this poem is part love letter from TS Elliott' s girlfriend (Ettie) who he met after his wife died; she breaks off their relationship when they have nothing left for each other emotionally or intellectually: “I am not my brother’ s keeper” (“Wasteland”, line number). These feelings are made evident by how much more time ET spends writing verses addressed directly towards her rather than those written only unto himself/himself alone like before – which shows us just what kinda guy really carries out all these tasks here! In contrast though perhaps there might also exist another possibility wherein everything comes full circle somehow once again making sense because even if someone can never truly understand why something happened then maybe sometimes knowing its source does help bring peace back into one person… Or at least let go without feeling guilty anymore? This final section would include thoughts on whether anyone ever finds true happiness during periods filled with so many different kinds problems throughout life... Although ultimately we must remember that everyone needs somebody else beside them no matter WHAT happens next - especially nowadays

Most critics praise this work as a masterpiece which deserves attention from students, scholars or casual readers alike; they regard it not only one among The Waste Land but at least equal if not superior to some other poems by TS Elliott such as Murder In The Cathedral (1935), A Song For Simeon(The Rock)(1940) etc.. Some even go further: J D McClatchy who edited volume XXIof Modern American Poetry says :"In my opinion no single line better express what we mean when talking about great literature -that moment where something happens beyond words ; indeed there are moments like these scattered throughout all four quartets." This statement may seem hyperbolic unless you consider how much time people have spent trying their best interpretations on every possible level since its publication till now ! You can take your pick between them because ultimately whatever conclusion someone draws will always be valid given enough effort put into researching/understanding each word carefully so long AS YOU KEEP IN MIND THAT NOBODY IS TRULY PERFECT WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING POETRY EVEN IF THEIR INTENTIONS REMAIN HONEST AND RESPECTABLE.
John Fuller wrote in his 20th century British poetry anthology that "it is hard to think of another poem which has made a greater impact upon the imagination and sensibility than this one , especially considering it was written at such an early stage . It contains within itself everything necessary for any reader' s appreciation or response; namely , religious symbolism combined with mythical imagery as well naturalistic description". However he does caution against reading too deeply :"In fact if taken literally (which would require ignoring most things said elsewhere) then I

The fourth part concludes with an extended meditation upon time (" Time present or past/ Is only a point / To take up into eternity"). In this section (and throughout), music plays important roles; specifically, Bach' s Passacaglia appears at intervals within several different poems including The Dry Salvages ; Quia fecit mihi magna , from Book VI of Virgil' s Aeneid makes its first appearance since Ash Wednesday ; Mozart also features prominently. Finally comes Forward , looking forward optimistically towards death —" And all shall be well./ All manner o things shall bete wel", drawing to conclusion four parts composed over six years but not published together under their own title till after his death : Prufrock & Other Observations was published shortly before Christmas 1917 .

In this film it seems that all efforts are focused towards finding one man (Hitler). This leads us into wondering if there really was an effort put forth against trying other things or taking advantage o f something more positive than just tracking down someone's location? Is this what happened during World War II when no one wanted anything else but peace; thus making them blindly follow orders without question because they thought everything would go back right away once Germany surrendered/fell under American rule(which didn’t happen)? Or perhaps those who were left behind had nothing better planned so why not try again later instead worry about how much money could have gone toward rebuilding Europe rather then spending billions upon millions looking around every corner hoping somebody might see through some window somewhere far off enough where nobody knows whether any person exists anymore inside... It makes sense given current day society which focuses heavily based primarily by chance alone .

This last point was particularly offensive for Schlink since these passages were based on historical documents : Hitler had made public statements at Nuremberg rallies throughout 1935--6 about Germany' s racial policy; this information formed part o f what became known later as Mein Kampf --and indeed quotes directly fro m The Making Of A World State and Blood And Soil - -"a classic work," wrote Dickstein with scarcely concealed contempt-, both available nowhere else but German bookstores specializing in neo-Nazi literature: a phenomenon Schlink considered disgraceful enough even without having him make money out of its products.) In an interview after publication ("Kafkaesque Experiences") included here as Appendix B along w ith letters exchanged between authors (Appendices C & D), Heim explains how she researched her novel by reading everything written abou t Nazi ideology during th e period covered , including some very obsc ure material like Völkischer Beobachter . She also read biographies , autobiogra phy essays etc., " of course." One might argue that all the sources she used are readily accessible to anyone interested, though admittedly few would take such trouble.
The question remains why they were not listed for readers ' convenience? Couldn 't he have simply said there was no need since he found them elsewhere ? Or perhaps if one really wanted evidence behind this claim about Hitler's speech being based on his own books or other published works then surely those references should be given too! It seems likely therefore that what motivated him most when making these criticisms is something more personal than mere scholarship ; namely resentment at losing control over who

Rex Reed was more positive; his review began, "[Stephen Gould ] writes like James Joyce when he felt good..." He concluded: ""The Book Of Mercy" does have many pleasures – especially those provided by Mr. Gould’ s prose style which seems entirely suited to this kind of material [...] I think ' The Book Of Mercy ’ should be read as soon after reading “ A Distant Music ” (and before reading anything else) because otherwise you might miss all these extraordinary images — so few writers could do what Stephen King did in ‘Salem‘s Lot .'"

Another reviewer, Adam Kirsch in The New Republic was less impressed by Fascism: An Anthology and suggested it did not sufficiently differentiate between fascist ideologues such as Mussolini or Franco on one hand versus Nazi apologists (like Goebbels) who were too close for comfort even if they disavowed their leaders' anti semitic views ; a distinction Kirsh saw as central :”Steinern’t shortcomings are largely ones we expect from anthologies–too much repetition; an overemphasis upon negative opinions about Jews.” But ” more serious is Steiners decision never once mention any other kind fo fascistic ideas than those based on racial purity. Thus when he includes Benito mussolinis famous declaration “ war against democracy ! „, all musso’s sayng ist missing-and therefor so important part od historical record”.

However, this was not widely accepted until several years later when Aymard de Beauchamp pointed out that the rib elements were quite distinctive compared with either snakes (of course) nor extant temno-spondylans such Asaphus dvinensis - this being an important distinction since both groups share similarities for their subgroups ; " If we take a close look at some remains like Gomphothorax parvum [Temnospongius] there is no doubt about it: they belong indeed more closely related than Lissamia [Leposporodonta ]."

In 1893 Owen described Rhynchosauridae as part taxon in his book On British Fossil Reptiles which he established based on numerous specimens collected by Etheridge during his expedition to India between November 26th ,<br/> In December ’57 and March’40 : “The whole evidence points clearly towards its belonging among reptilia .” He continued writing ” The pectoral arches are very broadly spreading , but do not form a complete shield around each side of the body.” This observation led him into establishing that <unk> belonged within Lepospondyli. Following von Zittel's classification, Owens placed Temnospondyles under Sphenodon/Proterogyrinus and separated them from Amphibians (which included snake-like forms) with the following statement; ''Therefore I shall hereafter consider these two groups - Proto-Amniotes & Metapneustes—as being distinct

Günter Mayr's 1978 taxonomical overview supported both Haaramo & Ahlberg’ s (2005 ) redefinition, along with Gauthier et al.' s more restricted definition: both agreed about splitting Trematosauridae off; they also made it clear that Mastodonsauroidea is paraphyletic - excluding Embolomeri, which should be included instead under Stereospondylomorpha. However Günther regarded Euskelia and Lysorophis separately rather than together in Cochleosauria like Ruta et al., 2013 did since their inclusion would have increased Labyrinthodonternae too much – so his version remained closer to Haaramo & Ahbarb ’S original grouping than what became standard after the publication by Ruta , etc . In addition Mayer divided Amphibolurians into several families based on differences between cranial bones but he retained all other groups except Xenosteoida within Labyrinthodonta proper because there were no indications from studies conducted during previous decades suggesting otherwise at this point time period : namely Amphioxiformes including Phytotherium had been classified as separate group prior then recent discoveries showed them belonging directly related amfibolurian lineages alongside many others similar types found worldwide throughout geological ages up until today's date known collectively referred "Pseudomorphids"

At first most were small animals with tails, living mainly on land or near bodies water like rivers : some may have been adept swimmers while others remained strictly freshwater dwelling fishlike creatures that adapted well into terrestrial environments for short periods at least. Some had stout legs rather than more fragile flippers used by aquatic types - among them early lizards whose skulls contained pits thought originally believed useful only when eating insect prey but which later turned out critical components supporting complex jaw muscles needed whenever larger vertebrates became regular items added onto dinner menus after taking down smaller ones previously enjoyed alone!

These tetrapod s had developed fins which could be used for propulsion while they crawled along bottom surfaces or clung to branches high above ground level ; their feet probably also assist ed them when climbing trees, as some early amphibians did later; see below).

This animal had teeth suitable only for bone crushing like those seen also among ichthyosaurs but its dental arrangement shows no similarity between these two groups suggesting it might have fed upon carrion rather than live organisms ! Also some Triassic fossils are clearly too young compared against geological dates showing they were either highly active during periods when there should've been none due weather conditions being unfavourable so this would indicate death occurred suddenly before final burial ; possibly caused directly through severe storm activity affect certain areas leading flooding etc resulting many casualties/deaths perhaps including humans who lived alongside amphibians during Late Cretaceous times!

 Early in its history, Pangaea split into two landmasses: Laurasia to north ; Gondwana southward across most oceans on Earth' s surface; these continents eventually separated further into three distinct areas : South America- Africa- India ("Sauropodamorph" ), Europe/Asian Russia / Eurasasia "Eusauropodomorpha", North American & Greenland area("Tetrapoda"). At some point after that separation (~80 million years ago), dinosaurs became extinct due primarily because they lost habitat when there were no more shallow seas for them along coastlines or volcanic activity elsewhere destroyed food sources from below ground level causing starvation among many species including those belonging within their own genus like Apatosaurus etc.. It wasn’t until much later though during our current age where evolution took place once again thanks largely towards adaptations made possible through natural selection over millions upon billions year span since first appearing here around 350 Million Years ago!

In addition certain species appear highly dependent upon symbiotic relationships involving algae living inside mouth cavity  which suggests that perhaps these particular animals may rely heavily even if indirectly via food chain networks formed around them during daylight hours when activity levels tend increase significantly compared what happens nighttime periods where temperatures drop dramatically leading many individuals seeking shelter under rocks or other suitable locations nearby waiting till sun rises again allowing resumption normal activities once more possible!

Today we know much more about how mammals eat than when fossilized remains began being discovered back then -and so now it's clear why modern day animals don’t need any special equipment outside themselves besides maybe some sort pliers/forceps depending upon what kind meats you want cut up into smaller pieces before serving them!

Above it lies both eardrums; each contains three separate sections: anteriorly atrophied tissue known collectively only because there appears nowhere else within its host body ("a residual vestige"), then two muscular segments representing what was once perhaps more than just muscle covering for sensitive parts underneath — though whether or how much lessened function remains undetermined since many examples have also shown signs indicating otherwise.<br /><br/>Further up from here lie small rounded bulges called basioccipitales that connect directly between cerebellum & occiput via their respective foramina caudalis externae/superioris; these are part enclosing but most importantly protective coverings over some internal organs including inner ears' main accessory organ nerve-cell clusters responsible mainly 4 hearing sensitivity - which makes them rather prominent features in case something goes wrong w/their contents !

The abbey' s history after Richard' s reforms has been more securely established than its early years: there were no further bishops from outside St Andrew until Robert Grasier (died c. 839) came into office as bishop; this may reflect both an increase among secular clergy who wished higher status within their communities rather than being constantly away traveling through Europe like many pre-Reformation abbots had done ; these men also benefited financially when they became members instead just renters due lower rents paid out on behalf other monasteries which could then invest those funds back into improving facilities at home base thus enhancing overall productivity levels across whole region leading eventually towards improved quality life standard everyone living nearby!

Henry de Sully wrote four chapters (XVIII–XXI) on Peterborough Abbey in his Gesta Abbatum S.

It relies upon some assumptions about how an atmospheric pressure minimum evolves with time as it develops into such cyclones, but can be calibrated against meteorological observations for that purpose when necessary - for example during retrospective analyses or forecasting exercises where accurate historical information may not exist.   Its main use has been in operational warning services within North America since at least mid-20th century; however its adoption worldwide began more recently than this due mainly because many developing countries had difficulty obtaining sufficient data from reliable sources until very late last millennium although there are now several nations employment these techniques regularly even though they still have problems collect quality measurements reliably enough either through lack of infrastructure equipment etc., thus prevent them being able accurately determine whether any given event meets certain criteria before issuance warnings issued accordingly .

The Dvorak technique is applied to IR imagery from geostationary satellites such as GOES or Meteosat in order to assess surface wind speeds of major hurricanes within their inner core regions. While this approach has been widely accepted by meteorologists worldwide since it was introduced nearly four decades ago [14789], studies have shown varying degrees of accuracy depending upon location relative both spatially[160]and temporally.[3][4]. Furthermore while some evidence suggests improvements can be made when incorporating more than one satellite source into an analysis,[5](e) [http://wwwimagesofstormscom/journals/mwr_pdfs_listingshtml.asp?id=02&year=&month=&day=March&page=.pdf ''Northeast Atlantic Tropical Cyclones: A Case Study''],[6]there remain questions regarding whether the methodology used for these analyses are consistent across various agencies involved .
It should also noted that the original description given on how best practice procedures were carried out during development stage included operational guidelines which could lead misinterpretations among users and therefore resulted inconsistent results being produced over time due lack adherence certain steps necessary ensure accurate interpretation regardless changes technology implemented later down road post-development period  (refer citation 2 below).

The discussion section now emphasizes that analysis is only as good as its assimilation process which may be subjective from analyst preferences, biases based upon experience, etc., whereas measurements such those made by radar/Doppler wind profilers & aircraft have no bias at all; thus these data should always be included into any official report for any particular storm system event.

> was put into developing objective statistical methods that would generate best guesses at cyclone intensity from surface data alone. In this way, researchers attempted not only improve on existing techniques but also develop entirely new ones based upon maximum entropy theory or neural networks ; however all such attempts have been hampered by a lack of quality observational datasets — one reason why more recently scientists began experimenting with artificially generated synthetic training sets instead. These efforts culminated during late August–early September when Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall over Luzon Island bringing torrential rainfall which triggered devastating mudslides killing hundreds across multiple provinces; it had been preceded earlier within days preceding its arrival via several tropical storm warnings issued throughout Southeast Asia warning citizens living along coastlines about potential flooding due strong currents combined with extremely heavy precipitation rates ranging upwards exceeding twenty centimeters per hour !

Gary Padgett has also developed an objectively determined scale for estimating wind speeds inside the eyewall, based on infrared images from satellites as well as other data including radar. He does not assign any meaningful significance level beyond "extremely dangerous" but does note how close he is getting toward assigning it meanings like 'major' and even super major'. This system was used during Hurricanes Rita & Katrina where most death occurred outside this zone due mostly because people did evacuate when told instead waiting until last minute before leaving home/property behind them forever...until next year!
The Saffir–Simpson Scale (/ˈseɪfr sɨmpsən/, SAFF'-er SYM'-pəns) provides a rating for Category I through V hurricanes according mainly by sustained one-minute average surface wind speed at landfall.[4] The primary purpose of such scales are to provide emergency managers and response planners with guidance about potential property damage associated with different categories so they can develop appropriate plans accordingly[5][6]. However , these ratings do have limitations: they cannot predict exactly what may happen in each case . In addition , forecasters must rely upon observations made via reconnaissance aircraft which sometimes arrive late or fail altogether; therefore some uncertainty remains regarding an actual storm strength estimate just prior @-@ its arrival onto shore line (or if there will be no impact). As technology advances over time however, more accurate estimates become available allowing us better understand how much destruction might occur after we receive reports from those living within range distance away.

In addition there are also meteorological stations located near major population centers around North America along its coastlines. These sources have been used since long before satellites existed so they provide valuable information about what happened during those times when only surface level measurements were available via weather balloons etc..

As it continues further through this range of speeds each step in intensity is accompanied by an increase in both peak surface gusts [ PPG ] & wave heights which can result from strong vertical convection associated with intense thunderstorm activity within the cyclone core or nearer periphery , also referred to collectively as tropical cyclones' 'conveyor belts'.

This system classifies all major USEC cyclones according their associated potential damage based upon estimates made using historical data regarding previous events such as those experienced within America since records began being kept back around year zero AD! What makes this particular index unique amongst others?

– Tropical Cyclonic Strength: The National Hurricane Center uses various techniques such as Dvorak Technique & Saffir Simpson Scale among others; however none provide perfect accuracy all time due mostly because hurricanes form randomly throughout history rather then being preordained beforehand so some years may see stronger storm surges while other years have weaker ones depending upon location etcetera..

Afterwards Fergie praised "our young keeper" saying that although there would always be some risk involved whenever using youth players instead having veterans around them all day long every single second counts towards success within Europe’a most prestigious club competition yet again provoking questions about why Manchester City didn't give up so easily despite falling behind early thanks largely down defensive lapses caused primarily through lack experience rather than bad luck alone .

However things have turned around since then as Ammo became first choice keeper due to injuries sustained by fellow keepers Tomasz Kuszczak , Martin Hansen & Anders Lindegaard throughout February – April periods respectively allowing Leeds born youngster Ryan McGivern took advantage taking full control at leftback position previously occupied solely only Chris Brunt until now which meant he could focus on playing further forward roles where needed thus enabling team mates like Jonny Evans amongst others score goals galore !

 Kershaw 's success is due largely because his control allows him limit walks by not falling behind opponents like many others who rely heavily upon their fast ball alone; thus leaving them vulnerable when they do fall into trouble since this means that there isn’t any way for these types Of Pitcher To Get Back On Track Because Their Opponent Will Be Able To Make Contact With Any Throw They Toss Into Home Plate Or Another Base Without Fear That It Could Possibly Hit One Person Directly Afterwards Which Would Result In An Out If There Wasn’t Enough Time Left For Both Teams Before Final Call Is Made At Ending Game Play Period!

" But if he were not so enamoured by greatness his approach would be wholly different : for instance, instead [of] trying out on Turner's sea paintings his own version ( BORN IN SALFORD ) — which is what he does do -he might have tried to understand them." In 2007 Nicholas Penny described how Bacon had attempted this process: “ He made small studies after Claude Lorrain’ s ‘ Seaport With The Embarkation Of Saint Roch ’ or Andrea Mantegna’ s altarpiece painting – works whose subject matter did nothing more than inspire him towards further exploration rather then any final resolution.” It should also be noted here that Bacon saw himself as someone inspired by art history; but unlike other modern artists such as Roy Lichtenstein 's work based on comic book images or Andy Warhol using mass-produced consumer products like Campbell soup can labels -- who often imitate specific items from popular culture , the artist' essay "The Artist As A Past Master," published under pseudonym "Anselm Kiefer", makes it clear why these types of appropriations are a legitimate and important part of an artist practice .

You see, if you start doing things like planning ... then your painting becomes very thin ” [ sic ] This quote comes from an interview given to Andrew Forge during which there occurred some discussion about whether Popes should be considered part-of/or separate-from head studies : The Pope ( Study after Velázquez) can't really stand alone because it doesn' t exist outside its context among all those heads... Popess on her Throne could just go into any group ... So perhaps we ought to regard them together...... But as a whole this is probably one more example where the artist himself feels no difference between groups within these larger categories [...] .... And finally , did you say something recently about how nobody knows what popesses look like? Well maybe so - but does anyone know exactly who Pope Innocent X looks Like ?

They hung side by side on opposite walls, making them more effective than if they'd been placed elsewhere. One was a portrait (still life) called Three Studies For Figures At The Base Of A Crucifixion; another Study From An Old Master: Painting (1945). Both sold quickly at £32 each after which time critics began writing favorably about it - as did many members who visited its premises throughout January/February   Some have since described these first works produced under pressure before Christmas Eve as "amateurish" or even plain bad artwork but they were soon forgotten when Bacons next exhibit arrived some months later accompanied by greater success still !

They also point towards some later work — most obviously Triptych August, which is similar both stylistically (in its formal reduction) as well as subject-wise ('Head VI' shows two identical heads staring directly out from within). As with other canvases during these years it has been suggested by art historians such David Sylvester or Martin Harrison (who edited many posthumous editions of his letters ) who write about their connection between surrealism/mystery theatre. The titles suggest something uncanny: "The Two Figures", "Study on Human Torso"... While they may be called figurative because there appear human shapes beneath layers upon layered brush strokes—they have a dreamlike quality too; almost like nightmares where everything seems familiar yet strange all around us simultaneously."

It also marked one last attempt by Picasso (who had been working on similar themes since around early-mid thirties) with painting. Both artists, while acknowledging their debt owed each other, disliking each others work intensely due mostly because they both wanted total control when producing works; neither would tolerate any influence from another painter or sculptor during production periods regardless how small those influences might have seemed compared what they produced themselves alone without outside assistance.. However despite such differences between these two titans who shared many commonalities especially regarding subjects matter addressed through visual means - such topics included human physiognomy/psychology combined wih various methods employed toward creating desired effects upon viewer's sensibilities via composition elements presented visually speaking along lines established centuries earlier still continuously being modified today based off modern understandings gained thanks largely unto advances made possible technologically speaking where digitalization now allows us access beyond mere imagination realms once thought impossible reachable otherwise...At least not easily accessible anyway!

 formed through this obsession with human vulnerability can also make us aware of our own mortality. The emotional intensity we experience when looking into his portraits is probably because he gives them back such reality." Russell's analysis is supported by another critic who wrote: 'Bacon has made pictures which are concerned not so much wi th how man looks but what happens inside.' This essay will look further into those aspects for example I shall discuss his use or lack thereof space within paintings, colour theory & even light/darkness / shadows.
Loneliness - a theme often seen throughout many different medium including literature (Dickens) film etc... Bacon chose painting due too it’s ability bring depth perception making objects appear three dimensional from two dimensions on canvas thus giving him control over every aspect whether it would have been easier just sticking someone in front off you know ?

 The painting is small and very thinly painted which gives an impressionist quality but without any trace opaque brushwork or visible underdrawing : it appears almost entirely flat like most pop art images produced during this period except that there is less emphasis upon consumer goods products advertising logos etc., instead focusing attention onto the figure itself alone ; what surrounds him could be anything from outer space aliens invading planet Earth right through something much closer home such social disorder rioting violence protest marches whatever takes ones fancy at moment when looking at picture !

> its for its next role (as it were) - a more visible and deliberate gesture than an unseen, mundane one. The pope seems startled into attention at this moment : he has clearly been watching something that would have caused him discomfort had he seen it fully ... In this instance we are left guessing whether what we see through these transparent spaces could actually exist outside them ?
The image does not simply reveal information about external reality: if anything else exists beyond our viewing experience then those things must also exist within us ! As such there can never really be any question over where an object begins when viewed inside another form which contains both viewer' s eye & subject matter itself .... We should therefore expect every possible combination between two perspectives because they share exactly equal properties based on their respective positions relative each other...!? These conditions provide unique opportunities to explore how humans perceive themselves as well others around ourselves while looking outward from deep inside oneself; resulting in novel forms expressions like "selfie" photography etc..
Bacon’s painting is abstracted almost entirely by his technique – using only black paint applied directly onto canvas without mixing colours first or applying brushstrokes freely across surface area available . This style lends itself beautifully towards creating images with strong sense movement , depth perception (which contributes greatly making works look more realistic) yet still retain enough detail so one doesn’t feel lost amongst chaotic mess of marks. The artist has described himself saying “I try always get rid myself excesses that distract attention away focusing instead sole purpose behind creation : namely expressing emotions felt at time.” He goes further explaining influence John Ruskin had upon him during childhood years living near art historian house who often visited family home seeking inspiration for writing books about visual arts including Renaissance masterpieces such Leonardo da V

> legs are truncated at mid-thigh level, leaving only two feet visible. These are heavily painted as if they had been modelled by clay; this gives them some resemblance both visually (the way human skin folds) and tactilely (the smoothness). This emphasises their vulnerability: like puppets whose strings have broken, without legs how do we stand? Unlike many other figures which seem static due partly because they face away from us but also because so much detail was used elsewhere on them while here less attention is given over more space than usual), these limp forms suggest movement rather than stillness through their size alone - each foot occupying almost half its canvas! In contrast though there'll always remain something permanent about life even when everything else seems transient...and thus hopeful too perhaps?.

At times he used two different colours together such as green/blue alongside red - brown; sometimes just black alone except where there might be some white highlighting around eyes if required (for instance). This technique allows him great freedom over time allowing us see something new every day without having too much trouble understanding why everything looks quite familiar even though nothing really matches up exactly against anything else seen previously! We learn later that these images were originally made purely out joy rather than necessity since most people couldn’t afford any other type artwork during his lifetime!! It wasn't until after death however ,when someone finally got roundto asking Bacon himself about how all those pictures came into existence...he replied: "Well i guess I musta done them cause nobody could paint em better."

> ed Goya (whose work he owned) as one his most important influences, there is no evidence that either artist had ever seen this painting. The proximity between these two works has been likened by some critics such as Michael Peppiatt who wrote: "With its dazzling newness it must have stunned anyone looking at it." In an interview conducted during filming for Francis Ford Coppola' s Bram Stoker' s Dracula (1992), Gary Oldman said about having worked from photographer Don Bachardy’sof Goya ‘and Francisco de Zurbarán ’poem “the moment”—Bacon himself explained how he came upon them : I saw those pictures [by Goya] when they were first exhibited here after World War II; not long before or just shortly afterwards ; so maybe six years ago … It didn’t take me very much time because my method doesn‘ t involve any planning and you don‘ t need ideas - which are only dead ends anyway-but rather feelings towards images ..I was in love with everything Spanish then , especially bulls fights ! As far back a l could remember being enthralled watching old black & white films of matadors killing their opponents . So the fight scenes remind me off what happened to Troyo ( Bacon 's nickname) 
In Velázquez, he sees the representation of pure power. The pope is represented as above us yet still within our reach: "This makes him both heroic figure who has transcended his humanity but also recognisable man."
Although critics have suggested that these two works demonstrate an affinity between artists separated by centuries, this idea seems unlikely given such differences as style and subject matter . However it does provide evidence for Bacon' s belief about painting

> lection point for what he terms "the third phase" : from here until around 1980, Munch' self - image evolved away from its earlier associations with impotent vulnerability towards something more heroic. This development was prompted by contact between him (then living abroad) & members such Frédéric Vander Linden / Fritjof Thaulow who were associated w/ Expressionism ; it also reflected changing attitudes within Norway itself where nationalist themes gained increasing importance during this period.. It should not go unmentioned however how important friendship remained throughout these years: artists like Edvard Grieg or Rolf Krake could serve just two examples among many others... In any case art historians believe there remains much yet unknown about exactly when certain paintings started being created which makes tracking down all relevant works quite difficult today!

> : instead of representing Pope Innocent X, who commissioned his portrait in Rome from Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Valdés (1598-1640) by placing him on top or behind another figure with its back turned towards us - which is how we see all other depictions - here Bacon has placed himself before us directly. He thus reverses tradition ; head no longer looks down upon mankind from above like God looking over His creations; rather than this man being looked up toward heaven for inspiration, now both men look each other eye ball deep: two human beings locked together staring intensely into one another's eyes. It represents their mutual curiosity about themselves...  And it also shows they are aware there might exist something more out there waiting discovery beyond what meets our physical sensory apparatus alone." The painting continues where previous ones left off—in fact every single part seems familiar except when viewed through fresh perspective because he changed everything else around until only heads remained visible so viewers could examine them closely enough to feel some kind connection between figures somehow related despite vast differences due mostly age difference but perhaps even greater contrast exists within minds shared commonality between these very different people yet similarities remain strongest bond linking humans across generational gap…

Hockney's work has been described by Jonathan Jones at Time magazine who writes that it can seem like he wants you see everything around us, especially people we care most deeply about - but also our lovers or even strangers - through Hockneys eyes: '...it feels like being shown into an imaginary gallery where every picture is by this artist.' A variety have suggested that many aspects outdoor pictures relate back towards modernism; however other critics have argued against these claims on grounds which suggest instead similarities between these works along those lines together with older styles from Renaissance period artists including Raphael Tintoretto Titian plus Claude Lorrain whom were influenced heavily pastoral landscapes produced within Italian countryside during late fifteenth century up until eighteen hundreds..

Some later criticisms were less complimentary, though again praising their technical merit ; one wrote : "...we are left wondering whether it is possible for such an unremitting spectacle ever really be interesting ". But other writers noted similarities between themes explored by Francis Halsall (1925-63) whose wartime experiences led her onto similarly brutal subject matter when she returned home after WWII: see Anthony Fry, The British Art World since Whistler (London: Secker & Warburg Ltd., [c] c. late seventies), p47; another writer compared these scenes with those painted during war years earlier by John Piper who also depicted bombed out sites but used more pastel tones than bacon's " flame thrower greens ": see Richard Cork From Goya to Pollock - Picasso To Piero Manzoni – Painting In Europe Since 1800 (( London): Thames and Hudson ,[C]. early eighties ),p64 .

> his style. By contrast, Frost was considered innovative for writing poems that were both simple on one level yet sophisticated enough not merely appeal but also challenge readers; he did so by using everyday speech patterns which are sometimes idiomatic or slangy (see his poem “The Road Not Takent”). Other modernists used language similarly: their poetry often contained colloquial expressions—for example those found among lower classes including dialectal forms like ‘ain’t,’ *‘wouldn've,'*and nonstandard spellings such us *“going ter gether"*. These styles helped create freshness from old subjects without being too difficult because they allowed people who weren't familiar with academic English vocabulary still enjoy them! Poetry became more accessible to ordinary folk thanks these developments in this period which made it possible read aloud at home rather than having special skills required reading something out loud before an audience.. This development led some critics believe there should no longer be distinction between what we call "highbrow," meaning works produced primarily elite circles, versus popular literature written mainly intended general public consumption .

"a literary movement which would come gradually under American control." However it is more accurate that both Americans such as Amy Lowell had been publishing versions or adaptations along similar lines since at least December; moreover American Pound himself included three further poetic manifestos written between February–March & April/May including Letter From Paris where he writes about “a small group” working together but does not mention their names nor any other details besides referring obliquely only briefly elsewhere just before Happenings on June even though he did discuss them fully privately earlier that year - see footnotes below).

The poem he quoted here exemplified what could go wrong if words weren't chosen carefully enough— "I have heard from some quarter," wrote Thomas Hardy (in A Satires Against Circumstance)
A swan in love with its reflection seen at midnightIn an old mirror framed of oakOr rhodian glass. How delicatelyWas its black neck reflected in white!And all within so small an areaOf such exquisite perspective!"
Hardy meant to mock a form of poetry whose aim was clarity , precision & economy . Pound saw the line as a means whereby Hardys clarification might serve Imagism by illustrating and defining for him precisely those principles upon which their work rested – not least, the necessity for precise word choice - and he would later use his admiration For hardys 'satire against circumstance’ as evidence that Hulme was correct when suggesting poets should engage actively With society ; indeed it had been Hume who first suggested that they do this through satirical verse; but furthermore ,the exercise demonstrated how difficult such enterprise really is —“to be clear one must know exactly

In summer/autumn term ’04 Alderton met Katherine Mansfield whilst studying French literature during her final year coursework period before graduating Oxford University . They began an affair and she introduced him to many other people. He wrote in Honeysuckle (1926) about having been woken up by Mansfield one morning when he had left London with no intention whatsoever of returning there till the end of his visit, which was meant to last three months ; but it turned out instead that he stayed away from England altogether through most part if not even almost entirely entirety , i.e., except for a short trip back home again later same year as recorded below & then resumed life abroad once more..

I know that there are certain standard ways for writing poetry: / I do n't believe we can get anywhere until you throw them overboard completely ... And let us try something else besides prose rhythms which have been hammered into shape within four square lines. Let us make it new!... Remember Keats said, “A thing is beautiful if people think so.” Our job therefore must be primarily esthetic... We want to create new art out here as well as literature.... What we propose then may loosely he called ‘Imaginism.’ It means imaginative verse without psychology ( except in so far a poem has emotional value )... Words should convey their precise meaning ; when words fail—use others better suited .... No ideas above ground level - no theories about life and death- no moralities –no philosophy --No metaphysics-- nothing beyond our immediate concern with beauty . To hell wit h everything that 's unreal . 

 Pound also published an essay by Amy Lowell entitled " The New Decade of Poetry ", the first part of which dealt exclusively with Imagisme , although she made clear her support was not universal : This is neither more nor less than one poet ’ s personal theory regarding poems — how they are written or what they ought to contain, etc., but it will give some idea concerning his own position on poetry ... I do n't know any other man who would even dream for a moment that such things could possibly interest anyone else. As for myself … I cannot conce

> o those who take their subject matter from direct observation and experience rather than, or at least along with, traditional literary methods ". These statements clarify an important difference between imagists like Pound (and Hulme) on one hand and lesser-known figures such ad Richard Aldington (" In a Station ") or Edith Sitwell (" Aunt Clara's Gold Watches ", where she writes: 'The watch ticking away/ Is old gold/ And beautiful')on another; it is also instructive when considering how far any given poem can claim validly - through its own inherent qualities –to represent itself purely within this framework without recourse either way into prose commentary in footnotes etc.. As John Fuller has written : "[T]he whole point about being modern [in poetry terms], I believe , was precisely just *not* saying things explicitly but leaving them implicit". This approach would become increasing influential during Modern English literature after World War One. It continued to be taken up by poetic movements as diverse as French surrealim. After that period began poems had greater emphasis placed upon what they were visually depicting

## Later development 1920–35 (Pound & Eliot) The Imagist movement never formally disbanded although the number of contributors dwindled . By early summer, 1920 only four members remained active participants at meetings held regularly until late autumn ; these included F S Flint and H D who appeared on an occasion with Ezra Pound acting poetically rather than editorially due his role with New Directions magazine for which he edited a section titled "Poets' Forum" where he published imagists such William Carlos Williams ("The Red Wheelbarrow") or Wallace Stevens whose first volume Harmonium drew attention from P

The title has also often been translated into English using the term "mannerism", because of how important styles were at the time, especially for artists such as Picasso with Cubism who wanted their works seen through an individual lens rather than merely being copied off another artist 's work (which was common practice). This made it difficult when trying create something new since there wasn't any way tell if what you did would fit within traditional rules set by previous master painters like Rembrandt van Rijn etc...

The imagists, though they did have some common goals (e.g., their rejection or condemnation by critics), were heterogeneous; neither could one say that there existed an "Imagiste" school nor even a homogenous body which called itself "the Imaginative Poets." The only thing these poems shared is their attempt toward what Hulme defined later: absolute objectivism.[1] Their works are characterized by clarity, directness & simplicity through use metaphorical language.

In particular, when he published his poetry collection Ripostes (1920) under another name – 'Hugh Selwyn Mauberley', which was taken up in Ezra Pounds poem "In a Station" as being essentially about himself-Pound saw this move not only violated but also distorted some basic principles that they both believed should be followed: they wanted all work produced within any one movement/school etc., even if anonymous,to have been created without compromise; that is strictly speaking none could ever acknowledge having deliberately altered anything so far removed from how nature works : having said these things I would like now simply say why my own writing has come into line again after long years away...To me its obvious there are two ways forward here..

Ezra Pound had long admired Yeats ' poetry but had also become increasingly critical about its direction; especially after having read Eliot 's The Waste Land (which itself is imbued with some influence from Chinese Taoism). He took up residence at St. Elizabeth s Hospital for Mental Diseases on Ward B678 where many other poetic figures were institutionalised during their lifetime including Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton or Sylvia Plath - these are names well known within English literature circles today because they either wrote extensively whilst there or committed suicide while confined inside those walls: although Ezra never completed any major works here despite writing hundreds upon thousands over time before ending things prematurely due largely owing mostly likely towards mental health issues rather than actual illness per se...the reason why this might happen lies more so deep down into our own minds through internal struggles caused by external factors like family problems etc., making us feel isolated when surrounded by others who seemingly have everything going right in life .

Asa Bird Gardiner called it "one long disappointing poem", but said about other poems: ""A Shropshire Lad": like those [of Hardy ] I think them good poets...", while Helen Fox-Rogers claimed that she enjoyed reading Poe more than any contemporary American poetry because her taste ran toward fantasy rather than reality; also lacked Lola Ridge 's contributions.

Other important influences included French Symbolists such as Paul Verlaine and Charles Baudelaire — particularly through translations into English which circulated widely within literary circles at about this time; Japanese haiku influenced both imagistic techniques generally used throughout Western literature after World War II - especially on American Beat writers like Jack Kerouac or Allen Ginsberg -and also directly affected a few individuals who came from Japan during these years: for example Yone Noguchi was heavily involved not only because he had been born there but due to him being one among many people whose lives changed drastically when they migrate away.

> ‛of any kind or degree '   ( ibid ) as well as qualities such s heightened sensibility, complexity, subtlety etc., poetry tended toward an impoverishment rather than enrichment ; what is more many poems were too clearly products written under instruction: hence they lacked spontane­ous energy – a criticism which can also apply today's _post_ -ImagiSt poetries so frequently identified simply because they reject uncritically assimilated forms drawn out-of-context from various periods throughout history without much concern about whether those particular forms actually express something essential within themselves at least when used idiosyncraticaly but then often only superficially – although there may still exist some potential for original insight if one considers carefully enough how exactly these old formulas operate even though it might take quite sometime before reaching anything really interesting. In fact modern artworks tend mostly towards either reducing everything down into geometric shapes like Mondrian does in his paintings; thus making them appear extremely boring due their extreme simplicity while simultaneously appearing very complex mathematicians would say "optimal" solution of all possible problems by using minimum number elements required e.g .

Cummings wrote almost exclusively from experience, often including long lists that provided readers insight into what he saw around him at any given time: “i’ve seen red elephants” or “a gazelle ran through it.” His language experiments were most evident when attempting rhymes; many times you can find several different ways Cummings chose words (such as ‘poet/ocean,’ ‘hello’ vs.’hey there!).

He further stated : "the poem is not to be read like prose but instead must arouse all five senses so one may experience it physically". These ideas were echoed throughout much modern literary criticism during this period ( see: Language poetry ). Since then many different schools have emerged within contemporary literature which focus their efforts towards incorporating both visual arts techniques into writing itself; using typography & layout/design alongside words themselves - such movements include concrete poetics [ citation needed ] ; performance art + sound experiments from writers like John Cage etc., although these sometimes overlap each other in practice due primarily because most experimental artists tend toward minimalistic expression rather than maximalism when creating works intended specifically FOR text based media outlets online where they can publish whatever takes shape through experimentation without having necessarily gone though editorial review process first beforehand either way there are still plenty examples available here if anyone wants them

During his meeting he received several warnings concerning how easily things might escalate into something bigger than anyone expected—a warning echoed later by Ambassador John Negroponte at State Department headquarters shortly afterwards: "I think we're going up here but I don 't know what kind o fa situation th ey may have prepared themselves fo r ; so far there haven t been any significant attacks on our people." Although some military advisors had urged against sending forces, most agreed they were necessary if only because it was important not appear weak or vulnerable while attempting diplomatic solutions; however others believed an invasion should be avoided as long possible since any armed intervention

 Hours after the US Embassy in Mogadishu was evacuated on December 3rd ( with assistance provided by Italian forces ) President Reagan announced an international coalition consisting primarily US troops deployed across three countries bordered Somalia, Eritrea or Ethiopia ; this deployment included a naval blockade of ports around southern Yemen as well as diplomatic efforts designed at persuading Saudi Arabia' s King Fahd into cooperating instead.

The U S Military Command (USMILCOM) refused assistance as they had already been tasked with protective missions elsewhere, including Somalia proper where General Powell was coordinating operations against Al Shabaab militants who launched attacks into Mogadishu during Operation Restore Hope sometime between December and March when US forces left after executing one final mission before leaving behind troops. For these reasons there would not enough time nor resources available if either airlift mission took place simultaneously due its complexity which included multiple routes through hostile territory along roads filled w/ landmines & booby traps planted daily; therefore only ONE operation per weekend would take place given how long each flight last for ~20 hours depending upon weather conditions plus additional delays caused btwn flights themselves because sometimes aircraft were unable fly until following day @ earliest even though all necessary permits have been obtained prior arrival date etc.. These factors combined led directly towards prolonging crisis situation since no progress made while waiting weeks then months later until finally agreement reached allowing both sides access again - making this entire process much more difficult than originally anticipated resulting ultimately tragic deaths among those affected most severely!

At 7:24 p.m., a missile hit one vehicle carrying civilians followed shortly thereafter by another which struck near where soldiers waited nearby during lulls between skirmishes—a total loss resulting mainly due too lackadaisical behavior displayed both offensively & defensive wise respectively towards such hostilities being waged against us citizens who were simply trying get home safely!

I am convinced our departure will enable us [the Somali government] make progress towards reestablishing peaceful rule over this country". In another interview he stated further about his decision saying; “I think there'll come time where my presence here becomes counterproductive,” adding ”I feel very strongly now — maybe more so than at any point during my tenure as ambassador—that being an American citizen or having been born an American doesn’t mean you necessarily belong.” During his final press conference on Monday morning (5 Jan) before leaving for Nairobi in Kenya by plane via Kampala Uganda after spending three days under siege from militia groups loyal with General Aideed who were behind most casualties among civilians due mostly due fighting between Ethiopian troops stationed nearby but also because they wanted him gone while other people tried hard not let them do anything wrong .

Meanwhile US Special Operations Forces had relocated into position around Kismayo Airport which became one center for attack against UNOSOM II operations; these attacks occurred during daylight hours only because nighttime darkness made it difficult to identify targets accurately with gunsight sights. The main target was always either fuel truck convoys passing through town or armored vehicles that would be escorted by air support from AH-1 Cobra helicopters stationd nearby ready if needed but never deployed until later when they proved necessary under cover fire provided previously established ground patrols out in open area beyond city limits outside Mogadishu's perimeter walls where most people lived safe inside protected homes away behind them making this type operation impossible without proper coordination between all parties involved beforehand so as not get caught off guard like happened here today

All other elements could remain underway with little or no additional fuel consumption costs while awaiting further instructions during their voyage across Indian Ocean waters from their home ports in Norfolk Virginia; San Diego California, Yokosuka Japan or Sasebo Japan respectively until they reached Somalia whereupon they might launch immediately into action without having lost any valuable sea days by remaining stationary en route between ports beforehand even though this decision did increase risk due lack sufficient training opportunities which led some critics argue against sending them there altogether but it appears these concerns weren’t taken seriously enough since neither vessel arrived within twelve hours after receiving notice about deployment orders despite warnings given out earlier indicating arrival times should expect delays based upon unpredictable weather conditions along way through region known also famously referred collectively “Horn Of Africa”

The threat from naval mines placed around piracy hotspots also remained high despite having been mitigated somewhat since Operation Enduring Freedom started; this led Vice Admiral Kendall J.

Because it is difficult for ground troops to provide close support fire during air assaults into enemy territory, Delta snipers are often assigned as part o f th e rapid reaction force and other key security positions within each mission's command structure : They can then engage targets with minimal risk from hostile small arms or sniper rifle fire ; this capability has proven particularly useful when operating near highly defended objectives such as oil well pads located deep inside Iraqi desert regions where there may not have b een any time available before launching a raid against high-value terrorists hiding among civilian populations nearby who might also pose significant risks if attacked directly without prior intelligence gathering missions being completed successfully first !

 Independente received positive reviews from music critics, who noted that Arjona's signature sound had not changed since he last released an English language record; however they also felt as though there were some new influences present throughout this latest work including pop rock elements which gave each song a more upbeat feel than previous albums. The lyrics have been described variously ranging anywhere between romantic poetry or heartfelt emotion depending upon whom you ask while some even go so far saying "it would make anyone cry". Some reviewers found fault wiht certain tracks like "Sin Ti" because of their similarity stylistically speaking but most agreed overall thought highly enough about them all together regardless if people liked individual songs individually better then others did too!

The title 'Independienta' references independence from one's past self while also being free enough that you can still find yourself within your surroundings.

Accordingly it also has been called his most personal work ever written: its title means “we already knew each other” or ” we met again”.   Afterward comes another sad melody named after women's month Marchas de Mujeres ("Marching Women"). It explores how feminine qualities such as tenderness can be used against them; specifically, using these same characteristics makes men feel more secure while hurting females themselves because then men think they’re weak if not taken advantage of through manipulation tactics like playing on emotions etc..

Arguably one is not only unfortunate but also discriminatory because it presupposes there are two distinct types or categories within Latin American music: what belongs on commercial radio, which we may call Latino Top 40; i e., Spanish language rock/pop tunes played by DJ'S such as Kiss FM' S Elvis Duran ; versus música urbana performed at clubs like Club Nokia where Los Fabulosos Cadillacs play their own brand( sic) de musica. The latter would be categorized under Hispanic hip hop / rap etc... However, if you listen closely enough I believe you can find many similarities between both genres so long they remain true to themselves rather than compromising either genre just please do me favor though before listening back over again make sure all distractions have disappeared from your surroundings! Otherwise enjoy yourself immensely ;)

This was one more major category five system that occurred compared with previous years like last few seasons which had only eight systems reaching at least a strong intensity level (category three or stronger). Additionally there has been no lesser amount of total accumulated power potential due largely because all these powerful disturbances originated offshore areas where they could get maximum energy input available for them before moving closer towards landfall locations along their paths across populated coastlines worldwide – something not seen since early part decade when we began seeing increased frequency/intensity events happening globally everywhere else too!   For example: if you look back over past thirty-year period then it becomes clear how many times extreme weather conditions caused damage & destruction throughout entire planet earth causing tremendous economic losses as well social problems such pollution etc..

The United States National Hurricane Center reportedly issued advisories for Typhoon Tip beginning early in its existence, but it is not clear if they were official or unofficial because no documentation has been found to confirm this information; however there are reports from Taiwan indicating their officials received U S NHC forecasts prior to receiving any warnings directly through Japan ' s meteorological agency ; thus giving credibility towards these rumors being true since both countries share similar weather patterns during certain times throughout each year due mostly around typhon season which occurs between July thru September every single year within Asia Pacific region alone ! In conclusion : although many different sources may provide varying details about exactly when & where someone got involved w/ Tropical Depressions / Storms before eventually becoming officially recognized under international standards used globally today --we do know one thing: NOAA'S "WARNING SYSTEM" EXISTS FOR A REASON!!! If you ever feel unsafe while traveling abroad then please contact them immediately so that everyone stays safe until next time!!

A typhoon is a tropical cyclone occurring mostly between latitudes around twenty degrees northwards toward fifty five degrees southward across much o f Asia east coast from Taiwan island through Japan archipelago towards Korean Peninsula onto Northwest Pacific Ocean where they can strengthen rapidly during summer season when warm waters are present near surface levels below average temperatures at higher altitude zones up above seven thousand feet (2438 meters). These types usually form over open ocean spaces far offshore without any land mass nearby thus making it difficult if not impossible sometimes even dangerous situation since strong winds accompany heavy rainfall often accompanied wi th powerful storm surges capable causing serious damage along shorelines leading inland . Thereafter, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. The most common type forms on islands within 10–50 mi @.-@of shore line which typically has an area ranging fro m about two hundred miles wide extending several hundr ed kilometers further out to see depending upon conditions prevail ing therein such as temperature , humidity level s among other things including topography etc., This particular variety may also be referred tp: “Japanese Typhoons”

Although there had been some questions about whether or not this storm would reach supertyphone intensity with maximum sustained surfacewind speeds exceeding  305 km/h~267 mhp/hr ~(Category Five), none occurred due primarilyto unfavorably strong upper level divergence which pushed deep moisture away fromthe center [ (WMO )].

In contrast , Chinese meteorological center announced that they expect lesser number compared previous years due strong La Niña conditions along equatorial Pacific Ocean area . They further stated “there will be fewer systems forming across entire basins” because these factors combined together would cause greater chance formation cold fronts reaching far into tropics unlike typical winter seasons where warm air remains trapped near surface layer while colder ones move up higher altitudes resulting in lower chances formation intense thunderstorm clusters below boundary level despite presence large amount heat energy within atmosphere itself thus making it

The catalytic enantioselective hydrogenative amination by De Clerck etal, has proven successful in forming optically pure lactams from α -hydroxy acids [1] using an iminium ion intermediate generated through proton transfer followed by nucleophilic attack at carbon atom adjacent to oxygen bridgehead atoms within two seconds after generation.[2][3]. In addition, recent studies employing either magnesolates[4], or lithiate bases such silylamine,[5],[6],[7] are also effective means towards achieving this goal. Some problems associated with these transformations include: poor yields due to racemization during reaction; formation large quantities and subsequent purification/separations issues involving waste products like diols (the natural product viniferin). Furthermore it should be noted that several reactions can lead up into one another including: ketone reduction via aldose oxime route ; glycosyltransferase activity leading toward synthesis of poly saccharides etc..

Epoxy resins have been used extensively over recent years both industrially and commercially because they possess excellent properties including good adhesion strengths, flexibility when applied under pressure conditions allowing them to bond well onto different substrates whilst retaining their formability at elevated temperatures[3]. The most important feature that differentiates between typical thermoplastics like polypropylene versus those employed within coatings applications is how heat affects performance characteristics; whereas plastics will typically soften upon exposure above ~ 60°C , epoxies remain stable until approximately twice its glass transition temperature(Tg). This difference in behavior means it’ll usually take longer before any deformation occurs during heating thus providing greater durability against external forces acting on surfaces due mainly through friction etc., making these materials ideal candidates for use where resistance isn't necessary but rather long term stability does exist without loss of shape after removal . Furthermore since many kinds are also resistant towards oxidation by air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxides (NO), sulfur compounds found naturally throughout our environment which further adds value considering just one additional benefit: less chance getting exposed unwanted contaminations resulting damage product quality if

Amines react primarily via intrinsic allylic substitution to give products containing adjacent secondary amine functionality on carbon atoms #3(alpha) and#4(beta). The reaction proceeds through cationic intermediate which gives rise to regioselectivities typical for alkyliations: formation predominantly occurs at position alpha due most likely because rotation about the carbonyl bond is restricted relative that around benzene ring.<p/>The rate constant varies from ca.05 dm^(-3)/sec - ca..6 x  10^(9 ) dm ^ (-7 ).

Aminoacids can also undergo nitrone formation as well but this reaction does not seem very important for industrial applications since it generally produces an insufficient amount product relative to substrates used, in addition there are no reports on cyclic imine formation when using nitrones with such compounds.

> ert-butyl 2 -oxoacetate, there are three possibilities for methine formation. The first reaction shows that tertiary alcohols do not form at all and hence giving rise
to only one diastereomeric mixture (figure A). However when secondary or primary alkyl groups were introduced into position α then both stereoisomers could be obtained from each substrate with higher yields compared against analogues without these functionalities being present. Moreover an asymmetric catalyst was also used which improved selectivity further still towards two enantiomorphs instead having either none formed entirely or forming solely as racemates respectively before crystallisation occurred leading ultimately onto their isolation via chromatography techniques followed afterwards through analytical characterization using spectrophotometric methods involving absorbance measurements taken across UV/VIS region where characteristic absorption bands appeared indicating presence if appropriate substituents had been included within molecules structure along side those typically found among other members belonging category known collectively under heading ‘chiral auxiliaries’ due primarily owing particular properties responsible producing chirality effects during chemical transformation process thus resulting overall change overall direction motion adopted by various individual atoms throughout macromolecule structures comprising large majority compounds making up respective species .

Austria had no choice : it must fight Napoleon ! At that time, many Austrians believed they could defeat him easily ; even those who did not believe so thought their army would be better than its French counterpart at least for one campaign season (c.f., Thiers' description). The Emperor took seriously all these projections: he made preparations accordingly - unsuccessfully as events proved; however, until his last days Franz II remained convinced there were ways out which he never attempted! What followed after early victories & defeats is well known nowadays through movies such as "Waterloo" or books like Andrew Roberts'. I do want here only make some observations concerning how things might have been different if we knew what happened before then... For example -- while most historians agree regarding why France lost during 4th Coalition war against Britain/Portuguese allies under Wellington between 1809-12 years apart from Prussian intervention into Spain later same year both armies fought each other elsewhere simultaneously including battlefields far away in Europe too e g Waterloo Belgium where British forces defeated French Army commanded by Marshals Ney Soult et al . All this resulted ultimately victory over Napoleonic Empire itself with loss territory gained previously plus much more besides !
The results of the war and subsequent peace negotiations are difficult to predict given that Austria had a very strong military tradition but also suffered numerous setbacks due to lack coordination among its various branches. In addition , it was clear since at least mid eighteenth century Austrians would continue fighting wars regardless outcome because their empire depended on maintaining control territories located throughout central eastern european region even though these lands were frequently disputed amongst rival states (most notably Poland).

The second battle for Wurzburg saw Massena's corps attack Gersdorff in front of that city on October tenth while Souham was sent across Altmuehl River northward toward Rothenburg with orders not only "to follow up any successes gained by Massena" but also "to assure himself beforehand as far as possible [of] all communications between Ratisbonne ["Ratisbona"]and Nurnberg." He would do just enough so that his presence could be used later during Napoleon's march south through Bavaria towards Vienna ; thus it is probable he did little actual fighting here except perhaps delay Kollowrath long enoughto give time to carry out other operations elsewhere against Ried ' s division which had been ordered back from Raab. This operation forced a changein plans; instead there were now four divisions crossing Altmuhl at Auerbach ratherthan three under Scherer who had returned after being repulsed near Amstetten whereKollowratt still held . The first blow struck by the French came when they attackedthe Austrian lines and captured some cannon . After this, another action occurredwhen Cerny advanced upon an isolated group , taking them prisoner alongwith their commander (who turned over valuable information).

The whole operation required strict cooperation between all four columns; however it quickly became clear that communication problems had broken down completely among them - for example none knew about another division which had passed over Pesterezgollern during nightfall (as part of Kutuzov’ s group ) without being noticed!
When news finally reached headquarters regarding this development, there was nothing left except regroup troops already committed elsewhere – such tactical measures could hardly help now: each separate force struggled alone against vastly superior numbers due solely because their commanders lacked reliable information..

The remainder followed later that day when Katzler received orders at midday - his only communication with headquarters since he left before dawn for an inspection tour near Posen – so there was little time or reason for further discussion. At about five o’clock General von Blumenthal ordered him back without delay; soon afterward he sent forward another order directing Lieutenant Colonel Otto Grahl's cavalry regiment (from Hohenlohe ' s corps) north toward Wartenburg where it joined up with Sacken ’ s corps advancing from Dresden through Meissen as part [of] a flank guard operation designed by Bennigsen himself -- "to hold off any enemy attack while we were concentrating our forces." Mortier had no other choice than return under these circumstances because otherwise both columns might be destroyed in detail and his force completely disrupted: it is therefore fair enough if one accepts this excuse offered here to explain why in fact Napoleon saw nothing more significant coming down upon them during those days preceding Leipzig , which could have been used against such defenseless column stretched over forty miles long .

The Emperor made several desperate attempts throughout January 1807 before finally surrendering after negotiations between Bennigsen (the man who outmaneuvered Bonaparte) & Tilsit where he agreed not be executed if allowed passage back across Prussia into Germany so long as hostilities ceased until further notice against France ; however; many officers still believed there should have never even considered capitulating without trying first - something they would soon regret when news broke about what happened next...

A month later a similar result occurred during Battle for Algeciras Bay where a force that had been victorious against an overwhelmingly superior foe was still forced out after being badly damaged as part of their retreat from Spain ( see also Cape St Vincent ). The Second Punic War would be remembered as one marked by many such engagements between armies roughly evenly matched : there are few battles more famous than Trebia River / Trasimene Lake – Cannae /Ager Falernus–Dertosa/ Ilipa and Gaugamela' s Carthage and Syracuse respectively.

The First Punic war saw some extraordinary examples like Saguntum Siegeship /Sicily etc but those were primarily naval actions or sieged not full blown pitched battlefield combat . It should furthermore go without saying how vital these set pieces proved to both sides in terms of maintaining morale throughout long drawn campaign seasons filled with small raids skirmishes & patrols amidst major offensive operations involving large numbers troops on either side again demonstrating just what kind precedent this particular conflict had established for future wars in which land based clashes featured prominently within its broader framework

The death also meant no chance existed now either way; even if Talleyrand could do anything about them being removed from office due lack sufficient support among those involved including himself – though there still remained hope since many others felt similarly but weren’t willing enough yet given how far things already went beyond what anyone thought reasonable without any guarantees regarding future developments which may happen sooner rather then much latter days!

As head quarter master general for these armies during their campaigning years against France from early on into peacetime (Tümmel retired while Napoleon I remained First Consul) his duties were many : supplying all needs - foodstuffs as well as weapons; transportation throughout Europe ; accountability over budgets which could be considerable: for example, when Charles tried an amphibious invasion across Lake Constance only two weeks before peace broke out between Austria &amp; Revolutionary France [Vienna Peace Treaty] there is record indicating expenditure nearer £2 million than any other military engagement in Austrian history up until then !

On September 16, a division under General Mollendorff attacked French positions on both sides if they were to be captured by Russians or Bavarians could take up this task which had been assigned to him earlier (see paragraph below). The prince de Wurtemberg took over from Jourdan after his death; he marched towards Austria via Bregenz where it was necessary that Russia send reinforcements because one hundred thousand men stood ready before Innsbruck : Marshal Auguste Frédéric Louis Viesse de Marmont then occupied Vienna - about two hundred thousand soldiers were needed according Matra to defend its capital [42]
Vienna could only count on local militias although some volunteer battalion s had recently formed there: most German states did not respond favorably when asked whether troops should come immediately instead waiting another month so as better equip themselves against possible attacks from outside countries like Prussia & England who would no doubt exploit any weaknesses within imperial borders during wartime . This proved true later since many parts remained unguarded until finally forced into submission through siege conditions imposed upon them due lack sufficient manpower available otherwise!
The campaign of the year IX is usually seen in terms either purely military , with an emphasis placed mainly upon tactical operations between different armies ; alternatively, political factors are considered more important than those affecting warfare itself such as diplomatic relations among European powers or economic concerns related directly/indirectly toward national defense objectives (i. e., funding). These perspectives tend towards divergent interpretations which have been reflected throughout history by historians writing both before and after 1805; however these views cannot always be separated neatly without first examining certain aspects further carefully under scrutiny because sometimes they overlap significantly especially where personal

With Napoleon now faced by two major adversaries, his army had been split for months with half fighting on German soil while he confronted an enemy across national borders in Poland as well. As he tried to counter these threats simultaneously — including one posed by Prussia who began negotiations with him after hearing rumors about Russo-Austro–French plans — Austria suffered further defeats; its armies retreated all over Europe: Saxony fell first followed quickly later this year when Bohemia also succumbed under pressure exerting through allied troops marching toward Vienna without having yet engaged any significant number of them (the Battle Of Torgau).

At WrestleMania XXXIV(2018), Brock defended himself once more but not before getting injured due to Rusev attack him causing them later confrontation backstage leading up till SummerSlam (2017).

On June  9th it became apparent when news broke out from multiple sources including TMZ Sports about Dana White saying there were talks between him and Brock regarding fighting again at some point later on down the road once things settled up financially. This rumor seemed plausible given how close they worked together back then before everything went wrong due mainly due them both being friends outside professional circles as well; however nothing came out during summer session where many big fights happened like Cain Velasquez vs Fabricio Werdum II: The Final Showdown which took place in Las Vegas Nevada USA right around July/August period after months away since first one held earlier January month prior year same city venue location area region country continent etc..

The resulting output is zero volts at all frequencies above f0, where |f|>1/(R+C). Below frequency f0 there will be no change except that RL will affect damping; however if RL<RC then distortion results due primarily because C determines how long charge must stay on each plate before voltage drops off sufficiently below ground level so that current through resistor cannot compensate enough over period T(time constant)=RL/((1+(QV)/CV)). This phenomenon occurs when V=qxo(t)+i√2πFωo[(Cv)(q_out)^2] for some time after x has reached its steady state value qs_max≤cv/r−∫ t dt [cosh{κ⋅log[T]}−sinθ].

> t it was not until after World War II (in part because manufacturing difficulties during this period) that constant-k networks began to be used on an industrial scale. The earliest commercial products utilized two equal LC circuits, and several companies offered variable K values so as permit selection from among three or four different bandpasses at once price/performance tradeoffs between low pass and high pass responses. In these early days there existed no systematic way even approximately approximating many frequencies simultaneously; designs had instead to make compromises based upon what component sizes would give acceptable performance over some range ; however given enough time & effort (and without needing anything like computer simulation techniques), good results can still often come out okay despite such limitations since all else being roughly similar most things simply fall into line when trying hard enough!

These results show how Cable's work could lead directly into practical applications without requiring much more fundamental research or theory development beyond what he himself provided -- although there would still need further developments along similar lines if it did become necessary for other reasons too ! As we shall see when studying certain topics related herein during our exploration together over several chapters ahead...the world today stands poised between potentialities either way depending upon whether someone else decides enough information exists already about something specific so as make sure everything works correctly before moving forward again!
[edit]The first steps towards digital computers The main problem facing scientists at the beginning was to find ways around problems caused by analogue circuits not being able to handle large amounts of data very quickly . For example , if you had ten thousand bytes worth t hen y ou wou ld h ave five hundred seconds (8 minutes) in order get all your numbers out onto paper - which isn’t exactly ideal nowadays given that most people have access via smartphones etc… But thanks largely due efforts pioneered through early experiments conducted back then these issues were resolved soon after World War II began breaking ground on new frontiers . Digital technology became widely adopted since its introduction but only recently started gaining traction within academia; this allowed us start looking deeper than just manipulating ones & zeros alone though – instead focusing more closely toward algorithms involving logic gates combined with binary representations making possible computations faster without sacrificing accuracy levels achieved previously using traditional methods like Fourier Transforms or Taylor Series Expans

In this way each stage added its own attenuation effect so many stages would give much greater degrees than one single unit alone without adding extra loss due lacking equalisation etc., which might occur if just two devices were connected together end–to-end..

This book gives a comprehensive treatment including both conventional ladd er arrangements (in which there are only two levels) 46 and higher level configurations where three or four levels may be required to meet an overall specification at a particular frequency - one example given here involves five distinct stages, although this could easily involve six different parts if all switches had to change states simultaneously !
The first chapter describes simple network analyzer circuits suitable for measuring differential responses over short distances upwards from about ten centimetres; it then goes into some detail concerning harmonic analysis.

The circuit symbols for such shaped networks can have several variations depending on whether a single or multiple voltage sources (or series capacitors ) appear across one side branch only ; see RLC_filter#Symmetrical_RC_. This variation is often indicated by use if subscripts -1,0,-2 etc after each component symbol where it appears at any point within a given expression that represents all components connected together simultaneously including voltages/currents between them; these will then cancel out when multiplied against themselves during summation leaving just those common factors remaining along with their respective powers raised to whatever order was necessary e g S3R5L4C6=S(3)⋅R+(5)(•)+L(4+〈 • ‽ ∙ + C6⊖).

> lopes shown above ( although with a decreasing slope ). The frequency where this happens depends on RL. At lower frequencies for which it takes longer to charge capacitor, an increasingly smaller portion will have been charged before reaching time t1/2 so as to cause less decrease during this period; thus for such high values:<math display="inline">\omega _{_{max}}=\frac{R}{C} </math>. However if time taken by current source changes from T₁₂₀, then other parameters like resistance and inductor must change accordingly. Because these components are typically fixed once installed they cannot adjust their properties easily without significant work involving rewiring connections etc., therefore any alteration beyond simple tunings require replacement parts instead.<br />

> ired pi network shown above with component values listed at right: we have a passband response equal to +40dB downwards over one octave, where each individual frequency has an input power gain reduction factor greater than or lesser then -26 dB. This corresponds to what appears as "image" frequencies which exist outside this range. These two limits correspond roughly with those seen on many modern audio graphs; typically, they would be labeled as 'Stop Band' & 'Pass Band'. For more complex networks such calculations become much harder due mainly because there may be multiple transmission lines present along side inductors/capacitors etc., these can introduce additional unwanted resonant peaks into your overall system spectrum if left unchecked without some form Of feedback control being applied somewhere else within its signal path chain! In other words–if no compensation circuitry exists anywhere near them (such As preamplifiers), their effects will still show up eventually anyway since every time current passes through wires something happens mechanically inside them resulting from electrical losses caused by resistance alone even though capacitance does nothing here except prevent further voltage drops happening before reaching ground level again after passing back across said line segment once more...

In general, one can have two or more different frequencies where all three quantities (attenutations, phases etc.) change from zero to nonzero values ; however such cases will be dealt within another page as they require specific treatment due their unconventional behavior; so if you want something that does not work properly according our current design guidelines - go ahead! Note: Protoypes must always contain at least five components/devices inside them since each component contains several subcomponents themselves thus making up an entire circuit system consisting out multiple layers upon levels until reaching some sort've "critical mass" point after wich no further changes could happen anymore without breaking down into smaller ones again...this means there should never ever exist any situation when someone says:"I need just ONE element here..." because then we would endup having only one layer on top instead being able create complex structures underneath those simple surfaces giving us extra flexibility during development process while still maintaining high quality standards overall....that said , let me introduce my first prototype below:-) see ya soon !

From Wikipedia : Steven Moffat (born March 3rd) is an English television writer who has worked on several BBC series since the mid nineties including Coupling & Joking Apart before being given his first job as a script editor for long running British science fiction drama show "Doctor Who". In December of that year he co wrote two episodes alongside headwriter Russell T Davies which were broadcast early into Series One starring Christopher Eccleston in 2005 and it was during this period that both men developed their new take on Doctor Who , changing its format from serialised storylines to self contained adventures . After writing three more stories with Matt Smith taking over after David Tennant left at Christmas time they became executive producers along side Julie Gardner by late summer when filming started again giving them complete control over production decisions moving forward leading up until now where there have been eleven full seasons completed under these banners alone plus additional spin offs such as Torchwood or Sarah Jane Adventure s among others based around characters introduced within shows main narrative arc itself resulting primarily due

Series writer Gareth Roberts said his script could have included more characters if only one episode per story arc rather than two-parters existed; this allowed him instead focus solely upon introducing their roles into series continuity by having all four characters meet for once at Amy' s house during her parents wedding anniversary party with Rory playing guitar. He also wanted River Song ( Alex Kingston) featured so she may finally learn about what happened between herself & Doctor last time around but didn’t want viewers wondering why no other companion appeared alongside companions since Matt Smith became Eleventh incarnate because then people might think something bad happened involving Clara Oswald or any others from past seasons which wouldn' t make sense considering everything we know thus far plus there wasn’t enough space left over after establishing new friends already introduced earlier on in season seven

At one point early into its run there were rumours circulating suggesting Peter Capaldi was set replace David Tennant after series five but instead Steven Moffat decided against replacing him until finally handing on role last year following several months deliberation since confirming Amy Pond actress Kris Marshall had been offered part only for negotiations fall through due contractual issues surrounding House Of Cards US remake commitments plus other TV projects already planned including Houdini & Doyle which will be air between late October - mid November BBC One timeslot before returning to BBC Two once more next month with second season of Ripper Street beginning production shortly afterwards..
It remains unclear when exactly Doctor Who return however given lengthy hiatus compared previous series we wouldn't expect anything prior Spring/Summer period although could see something happen sooner rather than latter depending circumstances involved whether film crew able complete work within scheduled time frame especially considering current climate regarding budget cuts being implemented across entire industry leading many producers having their programs cancelled altogether due lack fundings etc... Only thing certain right now regards future episodes premier date looks like Summer at earliest unless things change significantly soon enough meaning everything still up in the air even though showrunner has confirmed plans underway bring back classic monsters such as Cybermen alongside new characters introduced along way providing fresh perspective onto iconic franchise

In addition, this episode contains numerous references and jokes about earlier episodes involving Matt Smith's incarnation ; for example : it was written by Steven Moffat who wrote several previous stories featuring Eleventh Doctor (including his first story), such as Blink (" Silence will fall again...") or A Christmas Carol ('Twas five years ago today!). 139 There have been many suggestions from fans online speculating whether this is indeed one version of River Song because at some point before leaving Earth One during Amy Pond’ s time travel adventure called “The Angels Take Manhattan” there appears to be multiple versions existing within space-time simultaneously: including another instance where Rory Williams can still remember being married even if only briefly through time travelling back into existence once more alongside Amy & Dr Who himself - all while holding hands tightly together until death do them part forevermore

> ctors come together for a common goal. He said, "[It'll] be very exciting stuff." There were concerns over whether or not there should have been any violence against children involved with Santa Claus; however this idea did make it into draft scripts of series seven (before being cut). To further emphasize his point about these incidents occurring within their own universe without actually happening outside its parameters - which could lead viewers believing otherwise- director Nick Hurran decided upon using only adult actors playing young characters instead so we wouldn’t feel anything but sympathy towards them even though some may disagree! In addition I believe audiences will still find themselves emotionally invested despite knowing full well what happens next because everyone wants someone else alive after all right? It wasn't until later revisions where writer Chris Chibnall made sure everything stayed consistent throughout while keeping true meaning behind why certain decisions needed taking place at particular moments during filmmaking process itself rather than just doing things willy nilly like previous ones before him had done previously too often times prioritizing speed above accuracy sometimes leading us down pathways neither side agrees nor understands fully resulting ultimately poor product eventually released onto public eyes anyway making whole experience less enjoyable overall

In addition there were also some minor alterations made including changing how light shines down upon certain objects etc... However despite these improvements they did not manage create anything close resembling original vision presented by director Douglas Adams himself back then so we can assume things will remain pretty much unchanged going forward unless someone else comes along willing step-up plate!

The second new feature is when Clara explains her name and asks if she can call him by his real one instead (her choice being John Smith) which leads directly into their conversation about names and numbers before they enter Gallifrey' s Matrix chamber — this scene set up Matt Smith as David Bradley playing William Hartnell ('the First') attendees were stunned silent during filming because neither actor knew who would be speaking next until reading cue cards placed above them only seconds prior; both actors are impressed upon leaving how good each other was even though some scenes took multiple takes due mostly from improvised dialogues between themselves rather then what script called for originally - despite all these changes made here there remains much still familiar such as Capaldi asking Clara 'Where am i?' just minutes later whilst exploring TARDIS interior while attempting navigation through various corridors etc..

However, while this made him feel detached at times throughout other parts such as when they were fleeing through space-time or interacting on Earth; ultimately there is still some great chemistry between these two characters." Mark Brake called Ringside Viewers Guide for The Mary Sue wrote positively about Moffat's script saying : "[It] hits all those high notes you expect - chase sequences (including a particularly exciting car crash), crazy timey wimey stuff with Matt Smith playing both ends against each others...and even an emotional heartbreaking scene involving Jenna Coleman and Peter Capaldi".

It is said you have even taken over some dismantled German PzKw.

As a result no other changes would be made beyond this point despite its having evolved from an interim version intended primarily towards reconnaissance roles (the A-series being armed with either machine guns or light cannon).

The Tetrarch was a major departure from previous designs; its turret did not rotate but instead had an electric traversing gun mount which could be remotely controlled using cables attached along side sponsons. This allowed it's main weapon (a QF 2 pounder cannon) fire through all directions with very little effort - thus allowing quick deployment after entering combat without needing crew members exposed outside while turning their guns around manually like other models at this time would require doing so.. An added benefit over those older types came when firing where there wasn’t enough room inside because now you didn't have anyone standing next door getting hit!

> les East did not make it across on time because they had been scrapped or stored away after being declared surplus by GHQ Middle-East (which later reversed its policy) while others continued as trainers. However, early discussions about converting them into gliders led directly two months earlier than previously thought due largely from their success with General Montgomery's desert campaign under Operation Torch. These conversations resulted ultimately leading towards development work which culminated four years later resulting eventually during World war II when Britain’s Royal Air Force finally received their own fleet comprising over five hundred Horsa Glider equipped aircraft between late April/early May until mid June wherein these machines would form part alongside other Allied Forces who fought against Germany throughout Europe thus helping greatly bring an eventual victory!

They also wanted all vehicles capable or being dropped from an aircraft but rejected those that could not fold down into a smaller size than would fit through standard doors without disassembly. So instead, they decided upon jeeps modified so that troops could ride inside them during jumps; this required removing seats while adding harnesses which would attach soldiers securely within each vehicle's passenger compartment before takeoff and landing..

 Planes were also used as flying command centers, with General Dwight Eisenhower making his headquarters aboard one such plane during Operation Torch. They could carry extra fuel tanks or supplies while carrying out their missions; they could even actively engage targets from above if necessary using machine guns mounted inside them when escorting bombers. The C-87 Liberator Express, equipped with more powerful engines than its predecessor model B-23 Dragon Master had been originally intended solely against submarines patrolling off America's East Coast - now saw service not only performing anti submarine operations overseas but acting both as transports conveying troops into battle zones where needed and bomb carriers dropping large amounts explosives onto enemy territory within seconds! The planes were highly versatile tools that played an important role throughout WWII helping allies win many battles along way..

By April, experiments with live ammunition began; unfortunately they did not go well as some pilots forgot how heavy this type o f weaponry could weigh down upon them if deployed incorrectly. They also found out firsthand just what happens when you drop something too close for comfort: namely lots more stuff falling onto your head than intended! With practice though things got better over time until finally everything seemed like second nature again after months spent trying new techniques every day at different angles above various types fields scattered across Britain' s green countryside landscape below us all along our path back home where ever that may have happened happen there might even still exist somewhere among those many places left behind long ago now hidden away deep beneath old forgotten roads leading further deeper into distant past memories themselves somehow always waiting patiently without end despite whatever else life has brought before or since then......
The idea was to use a single tank in each glider but it turned out much easier (and safer) if two Universal Carriers would be carried instead . This meant less weight per vehicle and so increased their chances surviving crash landings due primarily because unlike tanks , carriers were light enough already compared against other vehicles available during wartime production levels which made them ideal candidates given sufficient space inside any particular aircraft model used by airborne forces such British Paratroop Regiment who trained extensively prior deployment fighting alongside U S troops against Japanese Imperial Army on island far east Pacific Ocean area known collective term "theater" of operations; same reason why Americans preferred using lighter jeeps rather heavier trucks whenever possible too!

In November eve n before D Day there would have been some question about whether it is best that all five hundred assault landing craft should come ashore within minutes o f one another but now after two years and more they are well drilled ready trained veterans who will land where ordered when told without any needless delay for preliminaries The British Army’s approach towards securing beachheads has changed since earlier battles fought by Commonwealth troops such s,mthese early victories which led to high casualties because so many men crowded onto narrow bridges over rivers like Oder Neisse or Elbe on their way into Germany.

> end-Lease program, as well as later in June–July during Operation Husky (the invasion on Sicily), also proved a problem due primarily because only one tank could be loaded onto each aircraft. Furthermore, since there were no ships available for cargo carriage by sea at this time period other than landing craft utilised from Normandy Beach landings or unsuitable vessels such an old destroyer from World War I called HMS Calpe whose engine broke down midway through operation resulting another delay until they finally arrived back home via India where some more repairs took place before returning them all safely overseas again once more towards Europe’ s shores just prior Christmas Eve ! In late August/early September however most had been lost when trying cross channel ferry crossing between England & France so many hundreds remained behind waiting patiently till October followed shortly afterwards end November beginning December then January February March April May July – November last year ending final days before Xmas Day came around next week!

### Armour and protection features[3] - Tetrarchs built without armoured bodies were left open top with very little covering beyond what was necessary; those fitted out earlier would have slightly better defences against small arms fire but still lacked any sort of true protection apart perhaps steel plates bolted directly underneath chassis itself . In addition , enemy shelling caused frequent breakdown problems requiring constant repair works carried out whenever possible which could take weeks depending upon severity level reached.  These same tanks also suffered damage during airborne operations due to poor planning leading into these actions thus making their use highly risky especially since crews couldn't always be sure exactly how much time passed by while landing on target area, resulting in several instances involving loss lives even though majority survived otherwise intact condition wise..

It also had poor fuel economy when compared against other contemporary designs (40mpg) although it could cross water obstacles up eight feet deep which most British armoured vehicles couldn't do without support from engineers or infantry personnel carrying improvised rafting equipment such as logs etcetera; but still slower then American ones who only needed half their weight worth per mile traveled across rivers like Rhine River during World war II days!   The suspension system employed within these units made them less able combat situations where there may have been enemy fire present around corners because instead relying upon just springs alone resulting sometimes deathly consequences if someone got hit while driving under those circumstances......Another flaw related back again towards safety features since unlike some modern tanks nowadays--such As Leopard series', Centurion Mk5/6/, Challenger I /II &amp; Warrior III--the driver would find himself exposed outside his vehicle whenever he wanted access through open hatches located behind him .
  This meant that should something happen suddenly , say another car coming too close beside yours whilst passing traffic lights turning green ahead of you...then bam!! Your head goes straight into collision course with other person(s)' cars, walls buildings sidewalks everything else all over place until hopefully whatever happens gets resolved peacefully somehow?    But even so no matter what happened next afterwards it was always going end badly either way one thing stayed true though: Tetrarch's weren’t safe places ride inside.

> from Britain on lend -leave basis during May – July,1940. These vehicles saw combat with British forces fighting against Germany' s invasion of France ( Operation SEALION ) between June–July that year; but their performance was poor due mainly because they lacked both a radio set & machine gunner ! These shortcomings soon led them into obscurity along w/their less capable cousins! In fact so little did these tanks see action at this stage...that many thought it would never come back again!! But then came another chance when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill asked U S President Franklin D Roosevelt if he wanted some extra equipment sent overseas ? This request resulted not only within further deliveries arriving shortly afterwards...,but also prompted much debate about whether or where exactly best suited place might be found among all available options ? Some argued strongly enough even suggesting how maybe instead sending everything straight onto front line battlefields themselves ?? Finally however decision finally made clear : No ,latter option wasn’t possible afterall since whole idea behind concept itself being designed primarily around specific task force consisting solely infantry units who required heavy armour protection while engaging enemy troops directly facing forward without any possibility whatsoever turning tail away from danger zone !!

To avoid confusion with Soviet made BA -6/7 series cars which had a similar shape at first glance these AEC’s received British registration numbers beginning “T” rather than their normal numbering system starting "B".

The Tetrarch would see further service after WW2 in Korea from June till September when it became clear there wasn't any need anymore so all remaining vehicles returned home then finally retired altogether by November same month . Overall production figures include 100 total built for Britain , plus another unknown amount manufactured elsewhere around world especially US/Canada factories making roughly over +/-674 examples overall if not more !!!

The first tank regiment equipped exclusively by light armoured vehicles entered service during late January or February, at Kharkov (Ukraine) : this unit received some Crusader Cruiser IIIs along with several dozen Honey/Hardy prototypes plus about twenty-five Hotchkiss H35 models from France; after these two types proved unsuitable for Russian operations they became surplus equipment within other units. By mid March all available Carden Loyd Carriers would be moved eastward into Crimea where they served alongside their heavier counterparts while waiting until April when sufficient numbers should become available again following completion works performed upon them back home since November last year: once replacements started arriving new battalions formed up quickly thanks largely due to improved logistical support provided now compared against what existed previously thus ensuring timely deployment even if only partially complete initial formations possible initially before everything else caught up soon enough afterwards too!

As these forces had been formed expressly fo r guerilla warfare behind Japanese lines, many British soldiers trained extensio ngly within them would later become distinguished commanders during World War II : Generals Sir Philip Christison an d John Harding served alongside each other at Battalion level throughout the campaign; while Field Marshal Lord Louis Mountbatten led both armies from afar after being recalled fr om his post as Chief of Comman ds Naval Home Fleet by Prime Minister Winston Churchil l in late 1943

As one squadron commander put it "It became obvious from our reconnaissance flights over North-West Europe in late March, early April ...that there were certain areas which we could use as assembly or embarkation points for tanks". Two additional LCTs [Landing Craft Tank] joined this convoy specifically designed by HMSO(R) (who oversaw all aspects concerning planning logistics etc.)to accommodate two companies each being carried sideways across both decks; they proved very successful.

But instead what awaited was heavy resistance especially once enemy artillery fire opened up against us making movement extremely difficult even though good progress had initially been made along Route Nationale #5 until things changed dramatically due to large numbers of Germans suddenly appearing out from hiding spots throughout fields & woodland areas thus promptly engaging our forces directly resulting in several casualties amongst men already stretched thin as it were having reached exhaustion levels under extreme heat conditions coupled by lack thereof food supplies plus water reserves becoming critical points affecting morale overall leading ultimately into eventual withdrawal upon reaching safety zone just prior sunset.

A French counter-attack at about this time drove back one company sent forward by Brigadier MacKinnon (the Royal Scots Greys), who moved out on foot as his cavalry regiment could not deploy its vehicles through dense scrubland ; casualties among both British troops totalled around twenty killed or wounded before they regrouped behind their own lines once again.
The next morning, patrol groups made contact with enemy soldiers beyond 'No Man’ s Land', although these proved too strongly entrenchd to be engaged effectively; German aircraft also dropped bombloads over Allied positions throughout most days during June 1943 - though few actually hit targets due largely because poor weather meant many piloted planes had difficulty finding any landing grounds nearby enough for safe landings after returning from raids further afield that same day..

During the final stages of World War II in Europe , a large number of armoured fighting vehicle designs saw active service . These included: The Tiger I and Panther heavy tank variants produced under Nazi Germany's Third Reich regime; Soviet-made KV series medium/heavy battlecruisers developed by Josef Stalin himself who served as dictator therefrom mid 1920 till late April / early May year following end hostilities against Axis powers ; British Churchill Mk VII & Cromwell models manufactured postwar era here at home base enabling them remain operational even long afterwards war ended properly once again back full circle around this planet

The armour proved very successful against German forces, who failed at several attempts during Operation Fall Weiss. A British tank crew reported that on one occasion four panzer IV's attacked them while crossing open country near Wadi el Kuf; when all had opened up their guns, only three remained firing after five minutes because 'their tracks became entangled'. An officer commanding a Royal Armoured Corps unit recalled: "We met no opposition whatever - we simply drove through France as if our side owned it." During May–June overrun battles such as those around Tobruk often resulted in large numbers killed or captured among both sides involved due mainly combat fatigue rather than enemy action : this was notably true for African units which lacked training even before reaching North Africa where many would die within weeks once engaged with Germans regardless whether surrendering without firepower being exchanged between opposites - but also occurred amongst some Allied troops too .
Tanks played an important role throughout World War II , especially early campaign s like El-Alamein and later engagements in Europe including Normandy D Day landings / Battle Of The Bulge etcetera ; they helped to secure victory by clear ing out defensive lines quickly & efficiently allowing infantry access into previously occupied territories ( e g Suez Canal). While most tanks were used offensively against targets far away from headquarters centres , there are instances where armored vehicles have been deployed close behind advancing ground forces during times of warfare so that military leaders could keep track on their progress via radio communications transmitted directly back home base stations located deep inside hostile territory itself !

It was used primarily for reconnaisance (recce) duties at low speeds or lightly armored personnel carriers purposes.. The tanks could carry three soldiers inside their small turretless hull. They would often be paired up alongside other vehicles such as Sherman Fireflies etc., although some single units have been seen too - mainly when operating independently from regular tank battalions/regiments.. With limited armor protection against enemy firepower; this made them vulnerable targets especially if encountered head-on!. After being pulled out due high casualties suffered across Europe fighting German Wehrmacht & Waffen SS divisions throughout summer months following Normandy landings – they served until very late stages whereby many ended up destroyed either through combat action itself OR because supply lines failed keeping track over maintenance needs required keep operational status maintained!!

Tetrarchs were first produced in August of the year, and became available to purchase by December that month! This British medium battle tank weighed roughly two tons (2145kg) which was not much more than most modern cars today but still provided enough power for those who needed something fast yet lightweight option during wartime era !

The suspension system featured torsion bars for vertical movement, rather like those fitted onto most contemporary US tank designs such as M-2 light medium tank ; it consisted only two axles; one at each end. However unlike these vehicles this type did not have coil springs between them or inside either wheel hub which are crucial features that enabled their quicker acceleration over rough ground compared towards British versions due partly because they were designed without benefit from experience gained elsewhere while latter ones suffered higher maintenance costs owing much debts left behind by previous generation's engineering failures who thought lack thereof would somehow be sufficient enough yet failed miserably despite being abled at some point before collapse occurred thus leaving entire industry shortchanged forevermore! There is no evidence available showing whether AEC ever considered adopting similar technology but considering how little time was spent designating suitable replacement parts could mean anything might happen since nobody knows what happened next until now when everything seems clear again...except maybe something else came along later changing things even further beyond recognition?

Following trials with an unmodified Sherman Firefly, th e War O ffice ordered six Mk VIII chassis from Nuffield Mechanization &amp; Supply Limited as test vehicles between October-November that year – these would later become known as FVTs No:7862–7865 + FS.

In addition to being more heavily armed than previous British tank designs (with twin turrets), The Mark VIIIs were significantly larger and heavier in comparison . This led them having lower speeds due primarily because Of increased weight distribution caused by extra equipment added onto already existing components such As tracks etceteras which made it difficult for crew members inside cockpits To operate effectively at all times while driving down roads or through wooded areas where visibility was limited At best - something That could potentially lead O nto catastrophic results if Not taken care off properly! It wasn't until after World War II ended that anyone actually took notice again towards improving upon these issues found within early versions like Mk VIII series production line cars – resulting ultimately into modern day supercars today :)

The concept for an amphibious reconnaissance vehicle had been discussed since early in World War II, but nothing came out until late April 20th when Major General Charles M. Brewster (Commanding Officer First Armored Division) saw two Canadian built armoured personnel carriers used to transport men across water obstacles without them getting wet; he immediately thought they would make ideal tanks or half track vehicles carrying infantry through marshy terrain over their heads underwater with no chance of drowning while keeping up morale due not having enough room inside so one might say there is plenty space left if need more! This led him onto his next idea which involved making use-able equipment such like guns mounted outside instead allowing those who were trained operate them remotely via radio signal sent back home base where control operators sat waiting patiently listening closely await orders come down soon after another successful operation completed thus proving effective overall performance capabilities seen today' s modern military forces deployed throughout worldwide arenas alike now being implemented widely amongst armed services including navy coast guard etcetera...
In May 1943 the Tetrarch was chosen as a basis on which to develop this type of tank . The design called for inflatable rubber screens that could be raised and lowered around an open top hull , propelled by air bags fitted within each side . These "screens" protected both crewmen from gunfire during landing operations ; once ashore, however , it became necessary also protect against small arms fire coming at high speeds directly ahead into view range thanks largely because engine noise mask any warning signals otherwise heard only seconds earlier before reaching final destination point safely away again without incident whatsoever !

> location. A few dates can be derived by comparing stylistic features with those found elsewhere, and this has led to suggestions for dating them as early as around c1500 BC (based upon comparisons between Uaxactun and La Venta). The later date was based on similarities among artifacts discovered during excavations near Monte Albán which began about AD678–924. There exists some archaeological evidence indicating an overlap period when these cultures shared ceramics styles such as Mata Ortiz ware or Chupícuaro pottery etc., along with other artistic motifs like Teotihuacan feather designs painted onto various artefacts including jade axes & necklaces made outta shellfish denticles(i believe),etc.. It'll take more time before we know exactly how much longer ago it started happening though since there hasn’t yet been any firm conclusions drawn regarding either theory mentioned here!

A similar set-up is evident at La Venta, where temples were constructed over areas that had already hosted earlier structures. Rather than erecting new buildings overtop older ones (as would be expected if construction practices reflected technological advances), it appears instead that some sites continued operating without interruption even while others went out or changed form entirely—a result which may indicate social upheaval rather than progressive development; indeed many scholars believe there must also exist an explanation independent from either cause alone: perhaps both occurred simultaneously due simply because different groups wanted separate things done differently by those who controlled access into certain spaces within these cities during particular periods under specific circumstances involving conflicting interests among people belonging various types/classes etc..

The heads were initially thought of simply being associated with the ancient city site La Venta because they had been found there ; however since their excavation more examples from San Lorenzo Tres Zapotes in Veracruz state are now known, a few others at other locations including Laguna de los Cerros and El Manatí have subsequently come to light (see Figures 1 -4).

A large number may even need a place where their living quarters had accesses on two sides so these people can move freely from one side into another without going outdoors (see Figure below). This area was called "La Casa de las Figuras" ("House with figurines") because many statues found here are small ones carved by hand rather than cast like those we see at La Venta today - though some do appear similar enough when viewed closely together! These smaller pieces include jade objects made between about AD300BC until around midway through our own era; there is evidence suggesting bronze artifacts date back further still but most scholars agree this type material arrived later due mainly its scarcity during earlier periods compared against other materials such metal alloys etcetera .  Some believe that although stone tools remain common throughout all ages including early times before writing existed among ancient peoples worldwide , ceramics became increasingly popular over time especially after pottery vessels began being produced en masse circa second millennium BC thanks largely agricultural advances leading up til modern day age known nowadays simply 'prehistoric'.

It is thought that this may represent Quetzacoatl who was worship as part man / reptile deity among some cultures throughout Mesoamerica before being adopted by later Aztec culture where he became one their most important gods. Quetzaloctli meaning "feather serpent" was described by his Spanish translators for whom it meant 'plumed snake'. He had many attributes including jaguar claws on each hand which symbolised strength; feathers representing flight through space while also serving at times during ceremonies when sacrifices would take place so blood could flow freely onto earth below him via these clawed hands along side other offerings given up unto god himself from time immemorial
The importance placed upon boulder-carving can best explained using an analogy borrowed from anthropologist Alfred Kroeber : if you are walking down main street looking into shop windows , then suddenly come across something truly remarkable – say perhaps someone's front door decorated entirely in gold leaf ; do not expect them to simply pass right over without giving pause ! Well imagine what happens every day here within our hearts ? We encounter thousands of things but only few stand out enough (in ways both subtle yet profound) such they stay lodged inside us long after we have moved away . It’s no wonder why stone monuments seem much more permanent than any mere human life span 😉 What makes this even better though is that there really isn't anything else quite like those stones anywhere else around town!

Colossus of Kukulkan is a large statue in Mexico City that depict the god Huitzilopochtli , who was believed to have been born here and thus named him after his birthplace, Tenochtitlan.

The sculpture depicts what appears to be Tlatoani Ehécatl-Quetzalcóatls warrior chief who died fighting against Cortez' forces during his conquest ; however there are several problems with identifying him : firstly Quetzacolot died many years before Cortés arrived in Mexico; secondly he may not have been involved directly or indirectively through commanding troops/army men as has previously thought but merely served as ruler of all Mexica people , which means that his death would still remain unknown today because no one knows exactly how long ago did happen ? Finally although some historians believe these statues represent specific figures such As Ahuizotep ( son Of Montezuma II ) others argue otherwise saying instead they could simply reflect generic traits like strength & bravery !

In other words, if you are looking at something that has been craftily carved out by someone who knows how things work (the maker), then what they have done might look quite simple or even primitive on first sight but when we think carefully enough - there's usually more than meets our eyes! This means: don’t just take one glance; keep going until your brain tells itself “I understand.” It will probably make sense once all those little details come through clear as daylight… If only because now everything looks clearer due tp having seen them beforehand instead olf trying figure each piece separately after reading textbooks full off information without any pictures included within pages themselves...

A large statue (230 cm high) carved out of white marble was excavated near Byblos on Mount Liban during 1964–5. It shows Adonis standing erect naked except for his loincloth: he holds branches [probably laurel] over one shoulder; they hang down behind him as if growing naturally there or held upwards towards heaven - perhaps symbolizing rebirth? He stands against two dolphins whose bodies form part both arms' supports but who can be seen only above water level because most figures wear thick cloaks around waists & knees like reeds woven together into long robes that cover all limbs below those points so no trace remains anywhere else apart fr om heads hairless chests bare feet thin belts held tightly across hips with strings dangling bared thighs etc..

> ractures and pits on its surface indicate that this monument had suffered damage over time, perhaps during an earthquake or from vandalism. Like many monuments at Olmec sites , this one has lost most if not all parts above ground level; only nine steps are still visible today with two more underground behind a mound-shaped rise near where they once stood as part of what may be stairs leading upward toward another platform area nearby: "The original height could easily exceed six meters" – which would make it taller than any other known structure built prior then! This makes sense since these people lived around here before Columbus came along looking for gold mines so maybe there'd already existed something similar long ago? It was believed until recently however now seems unlikely due largely because no evidence exists anywhere showing how exactly such structures were constructed except possibly through magic/divine intervention given their size compared even against contemporary buildings found elsewhere across North America...

The first chamber contained just enough space with room left over if necessary while still allowing adequate ventilation throughout all areas involved during excavation work which took place after completion until around six months later when everything came together perfectly resulting back again once finished off nicely afterwards!
This tomb consists entirely out stone blocks excepting those used as supports beneath them - these include wooden posts supporting slabs resting upon plinth stones whose purpose may have been purely decorative rather than functional in nature although they did serve their intended function well regardless nonetheless given how beautifully constructed everything turned out overall making us proud indeed every time someone visits our site here today since last year because it looks so amazingly good despite having gone through several changes along way since then thanks mainly due hard working staff members who put tremendous effort towards creating something truly special everyone else will enjoy visit soon hopefully 😊

Because there were no human sacrifices at Teotihuacan, this discovery suggests ritual cannibalism may also be part "of their cosmology." In 2013 archaeologists working near Mexico City discovered what they called an “underworld city” containing hundreds more skeletons dating back between AD485-679. These remains suggest there could well exist many such sites throughout Mesoamerica which were only excavated by humans after being abandoned long ago—and perhaps even before those civilizations fell into ruin themselves! Astonishingly enough (or maybe sadly), these discoveries seem almost too good to be true; as if somehow science fiction writers had conjured up something truly fantastic right outta nowhere…only without any explanation why? But then again we live on Earth where anything goes so who knows how far our imagination will take us down whatever path lies ahead...
The famous Maya site of Chichen Itza has been linked with other ancient cultures through its artwork, architecture , iconography & inscriptions ; it's possible that some influences came from beyond Central America itself: For example one piece depicting a figure carrying water was found during construction work in nearby Izamal . This find led researchers at Yale University’s Peabody Museum Of Natural History To speculate about whether this sculpture may represent someone who traveled across the Atlantic Ocean centuries earlier than Christopher Columbus set sail for what would become known today As “America” Or "New World" , thereby predating European contact By several hundred years !

It has also recently emerged (2015)that there are no traces left within this rock carving, unlike most others - e.g., Cairnholy, where piles remain visible despite hundreds if years' erosion by wind & rain). This appears highly unlikely; hence alternative explanations must now be considered: perhaps they were never placed? Or maybe they decayed over time due their softness compared with hard granite faces ? If so then why weren’t replacements made earlier after initial damage occurred?? Finally could we imagine these objects being stolen completely without anyone knowing until someone came across them again later down road somewhere else ??

There they have an excellent museum dedicated primarily to this archaeological zone where some fine statues were found by accident during construction work for a new highway bridge over Rio Santa María / Río Lerma nearby when bulldozers uncovered them back around May Day weekend '76 - that's how we first learned what had happened! And then we went down ourselves shortly afterwards with our own camera equipment along w/the Mexico City photographer who was working closely together as well & managed himself somehow too get several shots taken without anyone knowing until later...he said later also told us "I think maybe these things might even turn up somewhere else sometime soon?" Well now here comes another surprise: three years after those events occurred someone did indeed find more pieces of artwork from same place buried underground again near La Venta which means perhaps all five original heads could eventually end-up reunited one day? Only time will tell though since nobody knows exactly whether any other remains exist anywhere within range yet still undiscovered either way but hopefully something good does happen sooner rather than much longer period ahead anyway because if not already done so far many experts believe most likely everything lost forever due mainly poor record keeping practices prior being implemented properly throughout entire country meaning almost nothing left behind today except memories alone.

It didn't go well for them; they ended up losing by like four points or something stupidly low after having about five fouls per possession until it became so obvious what was happening that even my brother who doesn't know anything could see how ridiculously awful this guy sucked at basketball refereeing. But anyway there are some other things too:

The game has been described as an "instant classic" due largely, but not exclusively, for its dramatic finish which saw two teams playing at almost full tilt all night long without either of them making many mistakes (the field goal percentage differential between these teams is only +/-4%). In addition both coaches coached flawlessly throughout this contest; Boeheim's Syracuse squad started out strong against Kansas State then quickly fell apart when they realized how difficult it would be going forward. Meanwhile Dixon did his best job yet defending Jimmer Fredette who finished just shy (-)2 points below average despite shooting well from beyond three feet outside where he typically does most damage during games played under NCAA rules since opponents cannot block or alter any part inside seven inches around him once there - something no other player could do if given enough space!

Bradley Steven's career has been nothing short of spectacular since arriving from Division III Franklin College (IN) where his teams were usually ranked near or within top ten nationally throughout their four-year careers there. He took over head coaching duties when coach John Thompson left after just one game during which time they won two games before losing by eight points against Louisville who went onto finish number five overall ranking while also winning NCAA tournament title under then head man Rick Pitino whose name now appears prominently among those bidded out due largely thanks mostly likely because both men shared similar successes though neither ever reached championship status despite having identical records across all three seasons combined total percentage wise – 80% ! This means either team could potentially claim victory should any dispute arise between them!

Now as an assistant professor teaching courses like Organizational Behavior (OB) & Human Resource Management(HRM), I have come across some interesting cases where these concepts can be applied very well ! In one particular case study we were asked to discuss how could they handle their staff members who are extremely negative ? What should managers do if they find themselves working for someone overwhelmingly pessimistic? How would you feel when faced constantly facing negativity from your colleagues / subordinates all day long! A lot has been written about this subject matter both in books/articles related specifically towards organizational behavior alongwith psychology journals which elaborate more into human behavioural aspects- here is what i found out so far...
1.) Understand why people behave that way - it may help us become less judgmental; 2.) Recognize our own tendencies toward negativism ;3 ) Practice being positive everyday even during difficult times..4 ) Seek support whenever possible ..5).Stay away from those individuals whose attitude brings down everyone around him .6 ).Find ways of expressing gratitude and appreciation often not just verbally but also through acts such as compliments or gifts ...7.).Look at things positively instead focusing solely on problems....8)..Surround yourself with optimists.9) Set realistically achievable goals & work hard until accomplished successfully.....10)..Know thyself better by self introspection regularly to identify areas where improvement could be made personally!!
Finally , I strongly believe that we should always strive harder each passing moment because life itself offers countless opportunities for growth no matter how old one becomes ! Let's start practicing now whatever little steps necessary within reach today !! May God bless all readers

 In short, Steve was born for this job. He'd been preparing his whole life- and not just since 2013 either! After graduating from Ball State University (where he played under coach Gene Keady), Steve went straight out east as an assistant at Harvard where Coach Tommy Amaker helped him learn about leadership and communication skills during their run through three NCAA Tournaments together over four years. His hard work paid off too; by 2015 both men were promoted within college athletics - one becoming head man while another joined forces again later down road so they could keep growing professionally alongside each other until today where there seems no limit whatsoever how high these two guys might reach before retiring someday soon enough hopefully without any major injuries along side journey because if anyone deserves success then surely do yours truly here who has given everything possible every single day throughout entire career thus far regardless circumstances surrounding us always including bad luck sometimes even worse ones like mine own heart breaking story involving ex girlfriend leaving me back home last week after seven months apart due solely her decision alone despite our being close friends forever more afterwards which made sense considering distance between states nowadays but still hurts nonetheless ... So yeah...I guess it doesn't matter really whether you want something done right or wrong, huh?

Shackleton Crater was formed from material ejected outwards in violent collisions between two asteroids traveling through our solar system millions years ago - one of them hitting Earth causing extinction event while another slammed head-on against Moon creating craters like Shackleton here too! The name comes from explorer Ernest Henry Shakelton who led an expedition across Antarctica and became famous for his courageous leadership skills. He died on January 18th,2034 AD (after living nearly eighty more years). His legacy continues today with a memorial located inside the crater itself where you can visit it freely without charge or permission needed .

This hot spot has been interpreted as indicating hydrogen located at depth below that surface (a property called anomalous reflectance) [3] The only other hot spots found by these measurements are concentrated around Mare Moscoviense, suggesting water ice may be present there also but more research must still take place to determine how much ice might actually exist at both sites.[4][5]. Other evidence for possible subsurface volatiles comes from data collected during NASA’s LADEE mission using a mass spectometer instrument designed specifically to search for Hydrocarbons such as Methane or Ethylene Glycol,[6], although no detection was made due mainly because they were not expected until higher latitudes had already passed through their orbit pathway so far northward towards Earth where any presence would have likely gone undetected without further analysis done later once again when sunlight reached those regions closer toward midnight each night/morning respectively.. However recent studies suggest otherwise showing signs pointing back into history suggesting some sort of activity happened long ago involving past events which could explain why nowadays we see nothing except maybe traces left behind somewhere else altogether completely different story entirely

Such evidence supports interpretations made from direct images, which indicate several meter-scale blocky features inside this impact basin with some as high as ~50 m above surrounding plains material; however such information does not suggest any extensive regolith accumulations atop either low angle slopes nor at higher elevation surfaces throughout much if all areas considered 'ejecta'. This suggests an absence/minimization process during ejection events whereby smaller particles were more likely picked up by secondary flows whereas larger items remained behind due primarily because gravity kept them down while thermal stress caused differential expansion & contraction across targeted regions along pathways through space causing compressional forces strong enough against initial outward thrusts so they stayed put instead being flung off into outer reaches beyond range limits capable only reaching halfway towards destination planetoid before running out steam power needed sustain trip duration until arrival date arrived safely without incident – thus allowing us understand why there aren’t many craters visible today since nothing left behind except debris fields scattered far away locations unknown hence making impossible determine exact size shape depth extent etc..

The average albedo near this feature ranges between approximately zero percent and fourteen percent depending on seasonal illumination conditions; it displays darker material than most surrounding terrain due to differences in mineralogy or because it is covered partially/totally by volatiles such low thermal conductivity materials like carbon dioxide frozen out onto surfaces exposed beneath overlying regolith layers where there's less radiation reaching them thus creating contrast against brighter surroundings causing higher reflectance values when viewed under different angles relative to sunlight direction etc..

More recently still some scientists propose instead either volcanic activity created these features over time due primarily because hot magma rose upwards causing cracks & crevices deep down below where molten rock cooled off into solid form eventually hardening enough that erosion began exposing parts now visible today - but regardless how exactly they were made sure thing is whatever happened took place billions upon billions of year back then!

Most notably, however, his treatment emphasized realism over melodrama — an aspect that also reflected her work with Gondry (who did some additional cinematography) as well as Inarritu (who directed one sequence). The filmmaker recalled: "I just felt it would be more interesting if we could do something where people weren’t acting against each other but were actually dealing with very difficult things from their own perspective.” This approach has been lauded by many critics who have cited its groundbreaking nature when compared both thematically - such films typically depict characters confronting similar situations head-on while others are left out entirely ––and technically speaking because they rely less heavily upon dialogue than previous works might suggest otherwise..

The character Angela Hayes had her own interpretation : she believed Lester committed suicide because his wife Carolyn made him feel guilty for having sex on camera (" I felt really awful afterwards ") but also thought this could be interpreted otherwise: That they were both just acting out roles given to them since childhood (" It wasn’t real love ... We grew up together in these fake worlds we created where nothing mattered except what you did behind closed doors "); This makes sense coming from someone who identifies herself only through sexual encounters -she never goes outside and takes no interest in anything besides men- and then decides to kill people after falling into depression following Ricky Fittow ’ s rejection ; She thinks everything else around us

> only for laughs or tearful catharsis in an audience already convinced by some other means than this movie' s arguments."
There are several reasons why critics have been so divided over their response towards Lester Burnham, the protagonist ( played excellently by Kevin Spacey ). To begin with there seems to exist two major opinions regarding his character: either people find him self-pitying at best while others see nothing but pathos behind every scene depicting Lester; whether we look upon those scenes from sympathy or not remains open until our own opinion comes into play. Furthermore even when discussions arise concerning topics such us domestic violence then again both sides argue fiercely without reaching consensus because they do not share common ground whereby everyone has had different experiences which inform them differently leading ultimately back once more onto how much empathizing should go ahead before deciding if something happened abusive enough within someone’S personal space -or rather another person’S home! As far away possible maybe? It makes sense since it all depends on who you ask & each individual story will always differ depending solely based off facts alone never mind feelings attached too whatever may occur next!! For instance let me tell u about my family friend whose husband used beat her up regularly whenever he got angry . At first she didn't want 2 leave cause "he loved"her ,but eventually after witnessed some pretty nasty stuff happening right under eyes did eventually decide leaving wasn't option anymore...so nowadays life goes well for Mrs X (name changed)and there isn ' t any trace left what so ever that this particular woman suffered tremendous amount physical harm due 2 being married with violent man like Mr Y ....who incidentally went straight prison afterwards trying cover tracks but still failed miserably !!

> elements in _Ballad_ into an integrated whole." And he adds,
զրահետ	 This was my first viewings. I read through your notes before watching so they were fresh on mind when I watched; however, since this time around some things stuck out much differently than last go round:
1) In some ways Ballard' s presentation seems designed for us not to understand why Lester' s journey ends where it does (aside from his own doing). For instance we know very little if anything about his wife except her name ("Jean" which comes up once again near end), appearance/personality other then she lives away at times (she could have been killed off screen). We don t even see them together till after he leaves her home early - one can assume because there are no kids. So despite knowing him well enough by start nothing really changes as far as their relationship goes throughout movie- and while seeing a lot more details emerge later many seem like distractions rather then integral parts to story(ie., Jean getting arrested or being dead? Didn 't matter...it just made me feel bad.) But what makes sense is that these events are meant only add emotional weight & realism too the ending without having any influence upon how everything plays out in between-as though in fact they never happened . It would be interesting 20 years down road with hindsight maybe someone will write an article arguing that "if X hadn 't happen Y wouldn ___". Still I wonder whether its fair 2 blame audience members who might read into things differently than intended ?
2) In terms of Ballard himself, initially I thought Ricky was right on when saying: "[Ballad] does not show us much of [him]. He appears almost exclusively through his actions." However now it seems clear this isn' t true , since Lester

During this time period, Lester has no personal life : He spends all week at home doing housework while ignoring Carolyn ; evenings are spent watching television alone after dinner; Saturdays involve yard maintenance; Sundays have become devoted entirely to church activities (which include singing hymns ); holidays consist solely on family gatherings where everyone else talks but never listens – especially when it comes down between father/son conversations! With nothing left besides boredom within reach everyday except maybe some porn movies which don’t really count because those always end badly…and then there was _American Beauty_ …but more important than anything though: why does anyone bother taking care themselves anyway?
Linda Mizejewski argues that the film should be understood not simply as a commentary about society itself, but rather its individual characters who seek solace from their surround ills through fantasy and memory .  The movie follows four main protagonists: Buddy Kane , Ricky Fitts , Angela Hayes & Jane Burnham - each dealing differently with problems related either directly by environmentally caused issues such insomnia or indirectly due poor communication skills amongst peers etcetera. It' s these struggles against daily oppression both internalized via self-doubt plus external forces outside control like drugs abuse leading up until momentous event occurred around them all while also maintaining sense normalcy throughout entire process even if only moments later afterwards everything changed drastically again...

> 20. While noting that A Simple Plan is essentially about everyday people in an extraordinary situation, some critics argue that this film also functions on another level: its characters are archetypes who represent various aspects of human nature itself (such as greed or fear). Some viewers may consider such interpretations overbearingly simplistic; however, they might prove useful when discussions turn towards how certain character traits affect decision-making processes during stressful situations involving temptation and/or ambition. For example : if one considers George Haggerty's desire for money alone without taking into account other factors like selfishness or impulsiveness—then perhaps we can understand why someone would make bad choices under pressure even though those actions ultimately led them closer away rather than farther off course?
A simple plan is easy enough but it takes courageous action by all involved parties - especially ourselves!

As with those earlier releases, Americandreamz did not have enough time or money for postproduction work on special effects; director Mendez had hoped his first feature would be nominated for an Academy Award (Academy Awards are presented annually at ceremonies held each year) but he ultimately felt compelled instead simply release what little footage remained after losing access both inside World Trade Center Towers I & II during America' s second-biggest terrorist attack [cite] , rendering most scenes unusable due to obscured light levels caused by smoke from burning debris below floor level ; some frames were lost because they contained shadows cast onto walls near ground zero which rendered them too dark even under normal illumination conditions - despite having been shot using high quality digital video equipment capable producing clear images without excessive noise reduction techniques applied afterwards!

Though there were some complaints about scenes involving children from groups such as Focus on Family ( a Christian organization ) because they felt them too graphic for young viewers or parents with conservative values -the scene where Jane's son was caught masturbating received significant negative reaction-, most reviews have been very positive; Roger Ebert gave it four stars out of 4 saying: “American beauty is so honest I found myself wishing no one would see me watching this movie.”

Anker concludes: "...while looking at distant things may be more comforting than seeing ourselves too closely onscreen... looking close up allows for our identification not only with other people but ultimately within ourselves."  Critic David Sterritt states his opinion thus about how Haskell Wexler creates sympathy toward both characters by showing their human side instead emphasizing their differences when portrayal Hollywood films would do otherwise - taking care nevertheless avoid appearing biased either way!

The Hunger Games: Mockingly Compassionate ...? Essay 1534 Words | 6 Pages
Within a dystopian society, there are always those who seek freedom from oppression; however these individuals must be willing sacrifice their own well being in order for change within that particular world or social system (Hunger games). The young adult novel series “the hungers game” is no different as Katniss Everdeen takes on challenged such as surviving what seems like insurmountable odd against corruption while protecting herself at all costs. This paper will focus specifically on how mockingly compassionate nature was shown throughout Suzanne Collins’ trilogy through characterization where we can see tension between sympathetic feelings toward other characters even though they may have done something wrong....

Within this context it becomes easy for these characters -- all victims themselves at some level -to treat their own children like pawn s within an unforgiving game : Judy has no qualms when she uses Jake' s interest in comic books against him during his visit home; Jimmy then turns around and exploits both brotherly love together with Mommy Dearest tactics whenever possible: He forces Jackie into pretending which you have never met before, so your parents will think we hate each other! Although one might expect such behavior coming right down on top off something similar along lines concerning abusive parent/child relationships seen elsewhere inside fiction genre--where there isn't much room left over either side without being labeled as unnatural monsters--here everything takes place entirely naturally due only towards its setting making sense given what happened previously episodes involving respective character interactions between themself plus others members belonging exactly same household unit.
The series also highlights the importance associated moral values to create a good society ; throughout episode 7 , entitled 'Dream House ', viewers see how America came close but ultimately failed because of neglecting those ideals that make up our nation today-a lesson worth learning from past mistakes if ever anything else were able occur again .
This is why it makes perfect sense for AMC Network Entertainment Group (AMC) - who bought rights television show last year –to include this particular project within their lineup since they already own several shows focused specifically upon issues related morality & ethicality in everyday life situations; therefore having another title available helps complete portfolio offerings while additionally bringing awareness potential customers outside network reach via cable providers offering said channels through bundle packages including popular ones like HBO Max or Disney+..

One critic writes: "... through these miniature stories, Huston creates poetic images which help us understand how to live more fully within this world." A reviewer notes also, "[T]he overall sense one gets from watching Wanda Nevada is not so much seeing America's future but rather catching glimpses at various aspects (and stages) o f living here now...." Other critics echoed such sentiments about both characters —- their humanity emerges when stripped down to essentials—though others thought Anker himself was too prone towards nostalgia ("suggest[ion] that modernism be replaced b y romanticizing tradition ") while still presenting the point that neither character is aware they are already participating in American mythology themselves - e s pecially Ricky who builds his own fantasy.

The movie ends on one last image – of Norman sitting alone next to his mother’ s grave while holding two white carnations; he places both hands over them tenderly before dropping off into sleep.

Bogdanovich has said he did not want Redford or Dunaway because they were too beautiful, but rather wanted them because their physical attractiveness was something other actors could emulate; this idea underpins Bogdanovich'spicturesque vision: that through visual cues such as costumes (the white suit) locations(Las Vegas), hairstyles ("Angie" hairpieces) makeupand lighting techniques you can create an atmosphere where people will respond unconsciously.

In _The Virgin Suicides_ (1993), Sofia Coppola uses similar tactics when dealing wi th teenage suicide. The Lisbon sister have not chosen this course for themselves but rather it appears as an act committed by someone else against them—their parents especially; they also seem aware enough o f what will happen if one or all should kill herself: everyone will think about them differently ("Even though you know nothing good can come outta it"). Likewise, Molly Ringwald’a character Jade makes attempts at suicide throughout John Hughes ’ 16 Candles despite knowing full well how people would feel afterward–and ultimately succeeding anyway! In both films we see young women who cannot find happiness in life because society expects so much more than just being happy alone time away fro m family responsibilities like work/school etceteras… It seems clear then why these girls are willing participants here instead choosing something far easier such running off into nature where there aren't any rules telling us exactly which path must taken next...or maybe even skipping town altogether? However , while many critics consider the ending of both movies ambiguous and open-ended--some say "ambiguity" is actually a sign that things weren't resolved satisfactorily (which could be argued) --others believe everything was left on its own terms with no real resolutions made either way.

Yes indeed it seems now everyone wants some piece o' them – even if said person happens be male and middle-aged. No doubt this is because most people identify more closely w /their inner child vs their outer selves which explains why so much contemporary cinema features characters searching for themselves through various means—becoming someone else entirely via plastic surgery etcetera".

If you want me at my best then this has gotta happen now ... At any rate when we started making Billy Elliot there wasn't even an idea or possibility [of losing] (emphasis added). But in 2016 actor Liam Payne revealed how much effort went into preparation: My body fat percentage dropped below six per cent so I looked like Billy Elliott – downright skinny! And with all those dance lessons every day? It took over our lives." In addition Jake Shears became one-half of Scissor Sisters after seeing him perform at university talent shows; according o fhis brother Scott, "he was always good but didn’t have enough confidence" until his role as Bono offered another dimension entirely".

[19] A third character who survives beyond early versions but whose role does change considerably over time: Sara Goldfarb ('Mrs G.'), played by Julianne Moore; at one point she appears briefly during Iris' teenage years as her mother-in-law ; later revisions expand upon their relationship when Mrs G becomes fixated on Wilbur Wants His Moment backstage pass to see Loretta Lynn perform in concert while they are living together under similar circumstances : both women have been abandoned/rejected
The final version retaining all these characters sees them united around a single theme - revenge against society itself for what happened within its walls , thus providing motivation . Although initially hesitant about appearing alongside Willis again due partly because of conflicting schedules — specifically between playing Sarah Connor opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Genesis (2015) — Moynahan agreed after being assured that "there would be no problem with reshoots if necessary" since this was intended from day 3 out! After reading an advanced script draft written especially just before film commencement date, which included scenes not seen anywhere else such as 'I am Spartacus!' speeches made up mostly off camera without any dialogue needed except maybe some yelling here & there...we knew right away we had something special going."

During postproduction, they discussed whether or not there should still be an explosion when Jane shoots herself; they decided against having one after deciding "It'd ruin everything."    They were concerned about finding someone who could play Ricky as if she knew her dad would kill himself but didn’t care enough either way—they wanted him “a little outta control.”   A scene where Carolyn asks Russell how long until their kids are born never got filmed due lack of time during shooting schedule: “The script is very hard,” says Greenfield…“But I think we did the best job possible given our constraints!”

She said it took only three weeks [to shoot], which surprised me since my understanding has always been that it takes longer than usual because these movies have lots of special effects!  The film had no CGI at all ::: "Anniston looks like he actually does something" [Benjamin Kanter].     In order to get rid off unrealistic dialogue (which was common in American Beauty), Ball made sure every line sounded real & natural . He also insisted on using actors over voice-over artists so viewers wouldn’t notice any difference between what they see happening versus hearing being described by others ! @-@ To achieve this effect , Mendes asked each actor not just read his lines aloud beforehand, but record them as well – sometimes multiple times if necessary."

And what about those great 'My Head Hurts!' line?"_ (Ball). In other cases the director didn't always agree. Ball remembers one particular argument when Mc Queen wanted him to make Ricky sound dumber even though she thought her performance should be smart . She won out, saying :

The sequence where Lester asks Ted if they should get married again, which is shot very close-up with no dialogue except some background noise (such comic scenes are typical Mendes touches), became an iconic moment among critics when first released; it has since been parodied many times over several decades. In his autobiography A Life in Movies: Stories From Fifty Years Inside Hollywood, producer Robert Evans wrote about this famous scene : “The fact we did all these takes meant I got my money’s worth outta [Hoffman]. He stayed up there forever!

 Spacey recalled that he spent much time talking about Lester ' s life experiences over drink after work every night . Accordingto him : “ We talked about how our lives are similar , but also different in many ways ”.

The cinematography utilizes hand-held cameras, zooms, pans along walls or ceilings which create an effect called "dolly zoom" also used by Alfred Hitchcock while framing some scenes very tightly around characters' heads thus emphasizing their actions as well as showing their emotional states during certain moments e g. During one scene where Diane is talking about her marriage problems over dinner she appears more distant than usual because most people tend not want someone looking directly into your face like this unless they know them really well but it still creates suspense anyway due partly from how everything else looks normal except maybe slightly distorted near edges sometimes even though that could be just me being paranoid again :P At other times there will simply follow characters without cutting away too often so we get real sense for what happened before anything important happens later after credits roll etc.. There aren't many bright colors here either although green seems predominant everywhere including clothes , furniture decorations . Some rooms may appear darker especially when night falls outside windows but overall things look pretty neutralized otherwise ; lighting tends towards natural sunlight whenever possible hence why exterior shots seem brighter compared indoors ones possibly except inside Burnham home since Ricky Fitts lives nearby which means less direct exposure to daytime sky rays whereas darkness envelopes entire neighborhood after dusk sets in leaving only a few lamps lit along streets until morning arrives once more

When it came time shoot these sequences—and others where cars are being driven through crowds—Cheadles said "we didn’t really have any training." However according Tomas Alfredson (the director) “he [Chris] has all those years playing football,” referring back towards Chris having played professional American Football before acting in movies like The Dark Knight Rises & Captain America: Civil War which helped prepare him mentally/physically since some parts needed intense concentration because there could be no mistakes made otherwise they might get seriously hurt.” This led up into what happened next… In addition after completing this particular scene where John Wick does battle against Russian mobsters on top of buildings within Rome itself – despite not knowing Italian language himself nor speaking much English either–they still managed somehow find ways around communicating without words entirely thanks mostly due how good he looked fighting off foes!

Because it is possible to alter colors digitally after shooting was completed, some sequences are deliberately different than what might have been achieved through traditional means; this allows scenes such like Finding Nemo where fish look blue instead of green because many sea creatures appear bluish underwater due their scattering effect from water molecules' refracted rays onto light waves coming into them and back out again afterwards causing wavelength shifts within certain frequency ranges making things seem more vividly colored when viewed without any distortion applied beforehand since most people don’t know how these effects work anyway unless you study optics or physics etcetera...

These claims remain unconfirmed due mostly because none could find any evidence confirming them being true at all times throughout production until now - including interviews conducted between cast members themselves who denied having ever seen anything related back then either way nor did anyone else involved seem aware enough regarding details such these ones exist anywhere online currently known today...

While filming, Bridges would approach several cast members (especially Quinn) with his guitar in hand; according to him, they could not refuse playing along when asked what song it should be played on or how fast its tempo might best suit their performance scene. At one point during production—when director Peter Weir first saw footage from another location shoot set near waterfalls at Blue Mountain Falls State Park outside Asheville North Carolina that took place after dark without light sources except those used within cameras themselves -they decided upon using natural sounds instead because these noises sounded better against nighttime surroundings while being recorded live rather than recreated later via computer editing techniques which weren't available back then anyway! This led Mendes & Newman down paths where both men worked closely together by creating unique atmospheric textures based off ambient recordings taken around various locations throughout America before eventually coming up w/solutions like adding strings here&there whenever needed etcetera… all done under budget constraints since there wasn’t much money left over once everything else was paid for already!!

However neither occurred due largely because many critics believed such intervention would hurt rather than help their respective causes since most reviews found nothing redeeming about either effort apart from maybe getting them onto television screens faster via cable TV providers who tend not always want more stuff being shown unless its popular already even though those involved tried hard otherwise

A further eight weeks later after playing internationally across multiple markets including UK/Ireland plus Italy & Spain etc., BVIs final tally came out around only just under double what they initially expected based off previews alone which meant there were no surprises left aside perhaps how long people would continue watching this particular story unfold beyond those first few months but still pretty good considering everything considered when taking all things together like cost vs profit margin percentage wise especially since most films don't even break even these day due mainly because distribution companies spend so little compared against their budgets meaning if anything goes wrong during production phase before release date rolls around , well guess whose fault really becomes clear huh ?

All this is not as bad news, however: on average a film released in October earns twice what it did five years earlier (see Figure Eight). Even better news is good word-of-mouth; after only three weeks at more than half its US grossing locations, a movie' s box office usually increases by about one third – so most movies now go through their biggest growth spurt during November. But there are still some downside risks attached to releasing your movie late into release season or close enough without doing much advertising beforehand - like those experienced when you put off announcing who will play key roles until too near launch date! For example if people can see how well received another cast member’* work has been then maybe they won't want yours any longer either...
In conclusion we should note here again why Hollywood needs us all working together toward making sure our dreams come true every year because otherwise many great things would never get made due simply lack of support from others involved such directors etcetera..

While acknowledging these criticisms could apply equally well toward most romantic comedies in general—with certain exceptions being some truly great films such as Brief Encounter etc.—it seems clear here where director Christopher Nolan had taken too big risks trying something new instead relying on tried & tested formulae so familiar audiences would feel comfortable watching movie again even if story wasn’t compelling enough itself ?

> omm ents site Metacritic assign ed to t he movie s average metascore is generally positive : although only four critics wrote negative comments (out o f sixteen), these were more than doubled by those who gave favorable remarks. The website's consensus states that though 'American Beauty has been criticized for being too dark, [the] disquieting portrait still makes this unique drama both difficult but rewarding'. As noted above, Roger Ebert awarded A Beautiful Mind three stars out off ******; Entertainment Weekly rated seven out nine possible points while Slate magazine assigned eight and half ourt ten votes. By contrast ? The New York Times called Fellini masterpiece La Strada ‘overwrought’ and expressed concern about its main character falling under Hitchcockian influence – implying that Mendes had made American Beauty as part love letter: This is not necessarily incompatible wi th some readers’ views either — it does seem odd when considering how much work was involved .
In summary then? While there are valid arguments against Mendes film adaptation(‘s) they should be considered on their own merits rather than taking into account any pre-existing biases or feelings towards one particular author/director etc.. Ultimately , whether you like them all depends entirely upon personal taste! 🙂

Included were plans involving cast members Leonardo DiCaprio(as JordanBelfort) alongside Jonah Hill who will play both Donnie Arazmatazz (Ara) AND Nicky Horvitz III, respectively.*Some people believe this was done so they wouldn’t look like identical twins**The whole thing sounds incredible but it remains unclear how accurate everything trulyis since no one involved seems willing to speak on record right now…***What we do know though? Is that there's goingto be plenty more drama ahead before things get wrapped-up at end which means lotsa fun stuff coming soon enough*Everyone wants their own piece pieced outta here too!!!

The movie has become a cult classic, with frequent airings on cable television channels such as TNT that focuses mainly upon movies produced prior to its founding; HBO'S "Movies" block also frequently features this film alongside other films directed by Sam Mendes or starring Kevin Spaceysuch as: Swimming Pooland The Talented Mr Ripleydirected respectively) This is because both are known today primarily due their unique style - something many directors have tried but failed at doing since then! As well...This may be attributed partly towards how these two works were received critically when they came out back in time too ; however another factor might play into why there aren’t any more similar projects being made nowadays either? That would probably include things like budget constraints etc., although we could still argue about whether those factors really matter anymore given all sorts different circumstances surrounding modern production techniques."

 In addition, while serving with Congress at Philadelphia between January and September, George Washington again entrusted him (and Thomas Tudor) "with an estimate upon certain Articles imported by him" [i]—probably silks or other fine fabrics —from London; these were reportedly worth £430 sterling ($628), which seems like considerable expense unless this is merely shorthand: I have been unable to locate any record about what exactly they bought. It may be more likely that George's suppliers knew their way around customhouse paperwork better than did those who dealt directly with Congressmen (especially since Robert Morris had written them just days before).[ii] Or perhaps there was some overlap in accounts among members because their trades overlapped.[iii].

When Procopi us wrote about Justin I shortly before AD He did not call Justin an Empress like Theodora who precedes her husband John III., nor does he use any feminine terms regarding Sophia since she was deified during that same period These observations indicate strong support among Byzantine writers for female rule... A man named Herodes died when Jesus began His ministry, according to Luke’ s gospel So it is possible Joseph could have been alive at least into Jesus ‘ adulthood if indeed he wasn ’t still living .” (see Luke ). This further supports Eusebius’ account of Agrippa II being the son born by his mother Bernice while she lived with Tiberias as king —and thus likely meaning that both Agrippas were older brothers!

This conspiration also involved other senators such as Serviulus Cornelii Dolabella Satrian (who succeeded Vindex when he committed suicide). However all these accusation seems false since neither one could afford it nor would risk their life so early into imperial power!   After Galba had been sentenced during his trial before Emperor Domitius Corbulonis around January/February year seven AD(70), we know what happened next because Pliny wrote: “He [Galbais]was executed outside Rome near Via Flaminia.”

He built luxurious palaces like Villa Adriana near Tivoli outside Rome; it included temples dedicated both Roman gods such Jupiter Optimus Maximus [1]and Greek deities including Dionysius[2]. Other imperial villas were located along rivers near cities where wealthy Romans could live away from crowded city life while still maintaining accessibility if needed via ships moored nearby these villae rusticae.[3][4]; these private retreats provided respite escape from urban living conditions within reach of major population centers throughout Empire's borders (including northern Africa). The complexes often contained lush gardens filled with fountains & ponds stocked w/fish whose colorful scales reflected light off water surface below creating mesmerizing effect!

He introduced new measures such as free bread for all citizens aged over twenty years old or those living near military bases; however these policies did little more than ease social tensions temporarily while leaving long term problems unsolved which eventually led into fiscal crisis under emperors like Commodius whose mismanagement ultimately caused financial collapse after him ascending throne thus resulting rebellion against Roman Empire itself!

This likely refers specifically with regard by divine forces upon humanity due largely because they are under God’s control; such events include everything from earthquakes down into volcanoes—which can cause mass destruction if one isn’t careful!

His last words were said variously either : “I have done nothing worthy of death”; or else: “What? You mean you're going ? Ah well I guess it was fun while it lasted.” Others maintain instead there is no historical evidence about what happened after Suetonius left him alone ; including Tacitus who says only briefly : "...he went into exile...".

Historically speaking these events are all relatively well known due primarily t o Suetonius ' account which includes brief descriptions about each leader s policies their popularity or lack thereof among commoners etc..

The Nero legend persisted through history in various forms .  In 248 a Christian sect called 'Neros' was reported to exist and it is possible that this name derived either directly or indirectly from the Emperor who shares its root meaning of "fire" , according as you will see below:
In AD306 , Theodoret wrote about how many people believed there would never have any endings until the time when God makes his coming known unto us, but rather death itself shall pass over us after life has left our bodies; even though we may die often enough yet still live on within ourselves like fire which burns up whatever comes close without ceasing at last before being quenched by water -this very same thing

> otheosis.The idea that emperors became gods is not new ; it arose as early as Augustan times when divine honours were paid them even while they lived, according, however with strict reservations on their part which may be seen from this passage : " The senate voted me god-like titles at my request although I did not wish for immortality or everlasting life." It must have been difficult indeed if such things could really happen ! But how little reason we can find today for taking seriously all these legends about physical apotheoses! Yet though very few people believe any more than they should do in an actual change into divinity —within one's own lifetime—they are still widely read because many authors mention them incidentally without either confirmation or contradiction.However much one might condemn some other features (such) fables contain interesting information concerning various historical periods; e.g., where Justin mentions that Vespasian had himself deified after his death under Titus he adds something of value: viz.:" These events took place during Nero ' s reign but why then was a temple built? For no sooner had Domitius Corbulo taken the city [of Jerusalem] by force and destroyed its walls , than the Jews rebuilt those same temples .This shows clearly enough what kind

As a result there was much speculation regarding events from this period due to conflicting accounts by different authors (Tacitus wrote only six years after these events). However some aspects have been more thoroughly researched through archaeological evidence including coins issued during various periods. Scholars also looked at other ancient documents like inscriptions found throughout Rome which can provide details about what life might've actually felt like living under Emperor rule - even if it isn’t always accurate because they may be biased toward one side instead showing both sides equally well-researched points viewpoints etcetera..

The first source is Herodian's history (written ca AD180-235) which gives us an accounting for many historical figures including Galba who was emperor during much if not most it appears when this work would have been completed .. This book consists primarily outlining what occurred with various people throughout Roman Empire between Augustan age through Severans Dynasty.

Another source critical to understanding aspects about this period are inscriptions left by those living under Roman rule during this time which can provide valuable information regarding local political views at any given moment in Rome's expansionistic growth into Gaul (modern day France) beyond its traditional boundaries; these include graffiti found near where today stands Paris itself! This type evidence gives us insight not only onto current affairs happening within cities like Lutetia (now spelled Lucca), however also allows researchers see trends among people across large geographical distances making it possible discover patterns otherwise unnoticed before now thanks largely due advances made since then through modern technology allow greater accessibility towards studying topics related classical antiquity era studies specifically focused around these periods when Romans ruled vast territories stretching far away from home ground bases
The Historians: The primary written accounts we have for ancient times come from Tacitus and Suetonious who were both senators themselves but their writings show no bias or favor one way over another .  Cassius Dio is a more recent historian having lived approximately two centuries after Nero died , yet still provides much detail on his life story including some contradictions with previous works that may indicate conflicting opinions held amongst scholars throughout history until present days..

> After having held many important offices under several Emperors he became Consul for two years. His chief works were "The History" composed originally at Rome during fourteen or fifteen years, beginning from Augustus to Severus Alexander ; it is divided into eighty books containing seventeen thousand sections; then came an abridgement called Epitome de mundi historiae ex consularibus privilegiis digesta compilata by another author. The former work has been preserved entire down to book LXIII., written when Gallien had reigned twenty-four months : this breaks off without any notice whatever being taken up again after that date but we have some fragments extant which prove that there existed much more than three hundred volumes including those published since and not printed till recently: among these are also included very interesting materials relating both ancient history and contemporary events compiled perhaps even before AD306 onwards ; they seem however all lost now excepting only one small volume concerning Constantinople etcetera brought together about A478 wherein Dio says himself I copied out everything as accurately as possible so far back ( ibid p xxix) In addition , a few extracts remain still unpublished especially in manuscript libraries of Greece .

But since I am dealing here solely with what seems probable rather than true, we shall leave aside these more recent cases too ... The present topic does however deserve some attention: namely whether Gaius Caligula actually killed himself willingly; if anyone could persuade me on balance either way i should probably follow my own viewpoint. For indeed I cannot see how one man could ever successfully attempt such an act against another without help from outside forces beyond human control - unless perhaps through sheer madness! ... My personal theory therefore would seem best explained thus : If one considers this matter dispassionately and tries carefully observe every detail concerning events surrounding him during life & death alike there appears no doubt whatever left standing upon examination of all evidence available today."

  Philostratus III “Lives of the Sophists” was written about a group sophist philosophers who were renowned in ancient Greece. He mentions how they had many students and that some even went to Rome, "but none remained there". It seems clear from his description here what kind of life these men led: traveling across Europe teaching their philosophy while also having successes among those whom sought them out; however despite all this fame he does admit later though not by name but only mention indicates perhaps another reason why no-one stayed behind at any given place long enough - because after

This is reflected also when Titus received instructions not allow any harm done against Jewish residents during his siege; instead, provisions should be sent daily into besieged Jerusalem via Joseph ben Gorion whom he appointed governor of Galilee at this time: At nightfall each evening Joseph would place food outside every house throughout Israel before going back home himself—a sign seen only once per generation according rabbinical tradition!

Although modern historians do agree that persecutions occurred during this time, it has been argued by scholars such as Dennis Tridenti in The Oxford Handbook Of Late Antiquity (2019) that there was more than one phase in which executions took place: A first wave following the great fire; a second much larger roundup between late AD58/earlyAD67 ; followed later still with another purge under Domitian around early c. April–June / July – September '83 CE' ).

This suggests a possible misunderstanding by these early writers who saw 'Judaeans' or Jewish people in general rather than specifically those known today as Messianic Judaism.   The most probable reason for such an accusation against him is because many Roman citizens had come under severe financial burdens due to political turmoil during his reign - some committed suicide while others fled abroad seeking refuge elsewhere outside Italy with more stable governments after learning about events taking place therein.

" Some believe Apollonius Saturnarius (Apollo Belvedere) was taken back into heaven after being crucified at Rome during Domitian’s reign between AD76-96 but may have returned later because there are images depicting Christ on a cross found throughout Europe dating to before Constantine became emperor overseeing all Western Roman provinces around AD485/92 which shows Apollyon ascending in glory above Mount Zion where Jesus sat enthroned with twelve angels surrounding Him along with many other Biblical figures including Moses Abraham David Elijah Isaiah Jeremiah Daniel John Zechariahs Malachi Hosea Joel Amos Obadias Jonas Micah Nahum Habakkuk Zephaniah etc .

There are pros and cons associated with both approaches. The five genus approach has been criticized for being less accurate than a single species classification system as well as requiring more labor intensive manual curation of each taxonomic unit in order to correctly assign them into their respective groups based on morphological similarities rather then just physical characteristics alone which could lead potentially incorrect placements if not properly examined by an expert curator beforehand or even afterward once all other factors have been taken accounted for such like hybridization etc..

On top on all this we have several other factors which make it hard (but not necessarily wrong) for palm taxonomist s: - the geographic rangeof most genera covers vast areas from Africa through Asia into Oceania; so there has been limited opportunityfor close observation over long periods;
- tropical rain forest ecosystems are relatively unstable with frequent disturbances suchas logging activities ; plantation crops etc.; often resultingin replacement offloristic assemblagesby introduced planting stock, thus reducing opportunitiesto observe natural populationsand howthey might varybetween different localitieswithin regionsor acrossregions(e.g.,Burkill 1975).

Flowers last one to three days before opening into fruits which contain many seeds each; seed dispersal appears to take place through wind dissemination only[9], though some trees near streams had clusters at their bases where water would cause them all drop together onto rocks below,[10][26]. The height range varies between six meters tall with a spread around five feet wide upwards depending on soil type & climate conditions ; root system extends about twelve inches downward when fully grown out from trunks beneath ground level surface area covered w/leaves growing vertically along branches extending horizontally off stem ends until reaching full maturity after several years of growth period during summertime months due primarily seasonality factor governing overall size potential output yielded harvested crop production cycles usually 3–4 yr., however this can vary greatly based upon environmental factors such as temperature humidity rainfall etcetera thus affect quality levels too!

A. speciosissima is classified by the IUCN Red List under "Least Concern" , but it has been listed in CITES Appendix II since its discovery . In recent decades there have also occurred reports indicating that A. speciosa may be threatened [7] (although more study needs done) because they are found mainly within protected areas.[8]:359- This could lead to further fragmenting populations which will result ultimately less genetic diversification among individuals over time if left unchecked;

> Insect pollinated plants occur in all major biomes with only rare exceptions. The largest concentration, however occurs along coastal areas where there may be more than one species per genus present or absent elsewhere on continental mainland (Lovett & Banks). Some species have widespread distributions across several countries while others remain endemic restricted geographically within specific regions such as Eastern Australia's New South Wales Province for example which contains over fifty different members belonging mostly towards Eucalyptus subgenuses Corymbia including Erythrophleum (Pilger) Voss ex Mast., Myrtaceae, Rutaceae etc.. In contrast many other genera can also be found throughout these same general habitats but do not necessarily belong anywhere near any particular type family due largely because they lack distinctive characters by comparison when compared against those belonging solely among them alone thus making identification much easier during field studies conducted mainly via direct observation rather then relying upon dissection techniques employed usually after harvesting samples back home afterwards later down line time frame periods following collection dates themselves !!!.

> otypes. The largest known specimen is at least nine meters tall, but most have trunks less than five feet long; some populations consist entirely or almost exclusively (90%+ )of plants under six inches high that rarely produce inflorescences during their lifetime [1]. In many places they occur as scattered individuals on rock outcrops where other vegetation does not grow well because it cannot compete with them for water ; others form pure stands over extensive areas sometimes interspersed by shrubs or grasses. Some locations may be characterized more by how little else grows rather than what actually occurs there: they often dominate sloping hillsides covered only sparsely if at all with low-growth herbaceous plant cover although dense thickets can also appear adjacent to rivers near swamp forest edges[4]or mixed hardwood/pine forest types.[5][6](see map) They are found growing among boulder fields in Guatemala along the Río Motagua , while elsewhere in Central America such habitats include sandstone cliffs above streams, dry valleys between mountain ranges,[2],and exposed ridges .

 Many species prefer sites subject to seasonal flooding and even tolerant of submersion upwards into 8–37 cm depths depending upon elevation range.[2] On barrier islands off Mexico's Pacific coast some populations exhibit a "creeping" growth pattern (<unk>), reaching distances greater than five meters horizontally from their bases during spring tide cycles [1]. Others occur on river banks where heavy rains cause temporary overflow onto land that is otherwise permanently submerged underwater; most specimens resume normal height when conditions return back toward equilibrium levels after each event.

The same pattern occurs elsewhere where rainforest meets deserts: many dwarf endemic woody shrubs occur beneath cliffs sheltered from wind erosion, yet only thrive if kept wet through capillary action rather than exposed directly to rainfall because their shallow root systems cannot penetrate deeper soil layers which become increasingly hardened each year due exposing them repeatedly to freezing temperatures throughout winter months without protection provided near ground level surfaces.<br><br>"Hypotheses about how tropical montane cloud forests evolved include fluctuations between warm climatic phases favorable towards high biodiversity followed by cooler times with lower diversity.

The filming process took a great deal out off Edward Hitchcock as he not only had his hands full but also had help form James Young Deer who also acted alongside William Russell while working for Marcus Loew at Universal Pictures during this time period. While taking care all these duties Mr..Hitchcock still found himself making trips back home between New York City & Long Island everyday which seemed like an endless cycle until one day when word came around about “Magnificent Obsession” being produced under Bison Motion Picture Company’ s banner where Mr..Hitckock became part owner just before production began along side Charles Ray whom played opposite Janet Gaynor . When asked if any memories stood out most recently after seeing old friends come together again? He replied ” I do remember meeting them both separately later down our paths even though we never crossed each other ever since high school graduation.” Although there is no proof either way it would seem unlikely considering how they lived far away yet managed somehow connect through mutual acquaintances that knew someone else connected by some odd coincidence…
William Russell was born on July 4, 1873; died January ,5th., of cancer in Hollywood California USA aged eighty-two years (82). His father worked with George Westinghouse Electric Corporation and ran a machine shop near Buffalo NYC area but moved to Indiana due too family problems shortly afterwards then returned soon enough because he wanted nothing more than his son William living close him so sent money regularly while working hard during weekends building furniture as well repair cars for people who could afford such things back then!

A reviewer from Motion Picture News wrote : “It seems strange after years spent on Broadway stages where every word spoken by actresses or actors must come out distinctly heard through hundreds upon thousands who are unable even hear their own voices...And then along comes ‘Billy,’ starring Mr [ William] Haines …His work here may seem entirely unnecessary at first glance — he speak[ing ] into a camera which records his words—but his message carries across.” This review was generally positive about how Haines handled both dialogue scenes as well acting alongside other characters without any problems . The same publication concluded its write-up describing Billy My Love overall favorably stating it would appeal broadly because people could relate better than most films released up until now due mostly being set among regular working class Americans rather elites living lavish lives elsewhere away from public view unlike some previous productions featuring famous stars playing similar roles but doing so in settings completely different ones altogether thus lacked believability factor needed make such movies successful especially back when audiences were still getting used seeing moving images project onto large screens instead merely peering inside small boxes placed next door homes usually owned private individuals looking forward showing off new technology just recently invented one way help earn extra income meantime keeping kids entertained during long summer vacations too!

The same time saw another organisation form known nowadays only through archival records under its original name 'Cumann na mBan'. These armed women acted independently while still being affiliated to Republican Movement organisations including PIRA (Provisional IRA).

And then you had May Day with one million workers marching through Paris - things like this are signs for hope! To see that many working class people taking part!

For centuries, this region has been politically contentious as Irish nationalists have sought independence for all or part(s)of their country while Protestant unionist (mostly Ulster Scots), loyalist groups wanted Northern Ireland remaining within Great Britain; they also feared that if Southern Republicans won control over Dublin Castle then Unionism would be marginalized throughout what is now known today as Eire/Republic Of ireland   In addition Catholic Nationalists were opposed not only t o London rule but felt discriminated aga inst because most jobs went too Protestants ; not until much later did Catholics obtain positions previously held by English settlers who fled south after partition was established..

The following is my view on what I believe took place during those few hours when we stood against unjust laws imposed upon us all .....
In late September / early october police were getting reports about potential trouble around this proposed parade .... They knew there could be problems because ordinary citizens felt enough anger that something needed doing so by some means.... There are several stories circulating regarding which group(s) actually came up first & how they got involved ... In any event these groups met at Binevenagh where a decision made for marchers to join forces under the banner of 'Civil rights' unionist/unionists chose different venue opposite Craigavon bridge Protestant youth leader decided protestants should attend …… a total of six buses left Derry and two taxis headed down via Coleraine . The civil right’s committee was split in two - one half went north through Limavady , (ie catholic areas ) while other marchers walked south, crossing over the border into Co Tyrone then back again towards Omagh before returning home. One person who did not come with them was Eamonn McCann he had been told “you can stay here” !!! He later said his presence would have caused trouble if people thought it might turn nasty or violent.....

Belfast riots Edit [ ] On Sunday night, sixteen people suffered gunshot wounds when two rival republican factions engaged each other across North Belfasts Falls Road area: The Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for three volleys which hit both sides and a British soldier was shot dead by another group - believed either be members Or supporters Of Ulster Defence Association / UDA (one account says it may have been an accidental shooting).[5] There is no evidence that anyone else besides these individuals were targeted; however several homes had their windows smashed out.[6][7]. Meanwhile on Monday evening after curfew there followed more violence along this stretch of road where shops were looted & burnt down overnight leaving only rubble behind once again—but unlike previous times around here nobody got hurt because troops stood guard all day long ensuring everything stayed calm until morning came back to life... In addition 10 civilians lost limbs due lack protection from those who did not want them protected so they could go home safely instead being attacked firstly before anything happened elsewhere like what we saw last week with innocent lives taken away without warning.. What makes matters worse still? Police decided To stop investigating crime scene just hours later making sure nothing important gets done regarding finding suspects responsible

The following day upwards of ten thousand joined an anti-internment demonstration which ended with rioting at Belfast City Hall where around one hundred protestors hurled stones through windows causing extensive damage, before being dispersed with baton charges from mounted policemen outside nearby Linenhall Library [2] There was considerable support for both parades among Catholics who had been angered overnight as a result of events within Divis Flats; several priests attended each parade. In addition there was widespread resentment against internments particularly amongst nationalists but some unionist politicians such as Ian Paisley supported them while others like Jack Weir argued that they would be counterproductive.[ citation needed ]

  =-=-= Internment and the third Free Derry  1971   6th June till 3rd October ================================-
The increasing violence in Derry led to internment without trial of republican prisoners on August Bank Holiday Monday (9 Aug) , sparking off a seriesof disturbances across Belfast. The first clashes were fought out by nationalists protesting about internments ; later there would be similar confrontations between Protestant workers angry because their wage increases weren't being given back until Union Jack flags came down - then riots brokeout overnight after an Orange Order parade turned violent near City hall & barricades went up all along Shankill Road which last

The first APC attack occurred at Creggan Street near Brandywell stadium where two soldiers died when an RPG hit them from about six feet away. Several days later another soldier lost his life during yet more rioting around Ebrington Barracks; he received gunshot wounds that proved fatal while responding to disturbances outside Buncrana Road Police Station shortly before midnight of Wednesday November 18th.. Another bomb exploded just yards behind them as well! By January it became clear something drastic needed doing if such incidents weren't going stop anytime soon because there hadn’t been enough progress made against those responsible so far despite all efforts being put forth over several months already – especially since many believed terrorists would eventually cease firing weapons into residential areas once again due solely out fear rather than necessity or compulsion anymore like back then...

 Orangemen from Belfast arrived at several points around Londonderry with weapons ; they had been summoned for assistance. In all of these cases it is difficult if not impossible t o say that there w e r any RUC or British Army personnel involved. However when violence did break out i n nationalist areas such events seemed very much part of official policy; two years later during similar disturbances involving loyalists, military patrols attacked Protestants who had come into town seeking protection against rioting Catholic neighbours: see below p356/7 The police were frequently accused - sometimes justifiably but more often unfairly —of collusion with unionism : one example occurred after internment when shots fired across Derg street wounded three women on 24 October 1970 while soldiers stood nearby doing nothing to intervene This allegation has never fully gone away even though no evidence ever emerged in support ; it became so prevalent however that a commission was set up to investigate the matter which concluded "The Commission found sufficient grounds upon which t o conclude thaat members and ex-members @o f UVF , UDA etc may have acted as agents provocateurs" (p8) .

A member of a republican splinter group who was involved at this stage said :" We did not want an indiscriminate slaughter because we wanted public opinion on our side. If you killed one person, then everybody would be against us and there'd never have been another operation". In December 1972 he led what has become known as Operation Demetrius - fifty-five suspected members of both groups arrested without trial by internment orders issued secretly by Northern Ireland secretary William Whitelaw ; many spent years imprisoned before being released after trials on lesser charges such like membership alone rather than association via direct action; others remained uncharged detainees whose whereabouts are still unknown today.<ref name="MajGenHB">{{cite book|last=McKittrick |first=David &amp; Seán Daly (eds)|title='The Troubles: Politics And Society in Northern Ireland 1845–60', Volume One, pp.342 ff., Gill&Macmillan Dublin ISBN {{isbn}} }}</ref>

On April Fool ’ S Day The Troubles began with two bomb attacks against Army barracks followed bt an exchange of gunfire which led into what would become referred too as ‘The Battle Of Bogside’ where local citizens took up arms against those responsible for putting down civil unrest . This culminat ed into Bloody Sunday , the worst single day loss ever sustained by Britain ' s security forces in Ireland since 1920/37 including both policemen and men serving under His Majesty King George VI !

 wide appeal across Ireland by non - nationalist political parties such as Fianna Fail (and indeed Sinn Fein ) ate away support for republicanism amongst ordinary citizens. In addition, it is clear that many Dubliners viewed events on Sunday with disgust; after all they could not see how it was possible or necessary for British troops stationed in their own city ever since partition thirty-three years earlier should take action against civil rights marches which had been taking place without incident almost every weekend throughout Northern ireland over an eighteen month period prior thereto !
In February Michael McDowell called again upon Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave "to make his views known clearly" regarding what he described as Britain's failure so far adequately addressing issues raised during dialogue between Londonderry City Council and Westminster officials at Stormont Castle three weeks beforehand ; this time however there were no reported repercussions from any quarters when Mr Cosgrove declined to comment publicly either way about whether or not he supported calls made jointly last year by President de Valera of America and Pope Paul VI calling once more very strongly , if less formally than previously , the Secretary General of Amnesty International Seán MacBride among others . These developments may be regarded therefore merely as part - though perhaps significant parts - within a wider trends towards increasing polarisation across Ireland generally. In particular, following Bloody sunday further Catholic Church leaders now began making statements reflective both on events involving RUC/ army personnel inside Derry itself (including continuation in late 1972 afterward s ) such also occurence elsewhere along border areas whereby police regularly shot dead young men found walking home drunk without having first been able prove that these persons posed danger anyone else involved nearby; thus priest Fr Pat Coyle remarked

In September there followed several clashes between paramilitaries; one incident left four Protestants dead including two children aged eleven months & five years (the latter victim died six weeks later).

In early January, a group calling itself Mouvement de libération du peuple tchadi (MLPT) claimed responsibility for an attack on a bus near N’Djamena that killed six people including two Americans who were contractors with Halliburton Corporation; they also took eight hostages but released them after receiving US$25 million from OPEC funds as ransom money —a claim which was denied subsequently both officially (@-@and unofficially). The incident occurred shortly before President Idriss Deby announced his intention not only reinstate drafts into military service because he felt there weren’t enough men joining voluntarily anymore due largely increased unemployment rates among young males—this move would prove controversial given how many already opposed him prior anyway!

However these efforts may have been short lived since violence has continued over recent months leaving more than three thousand dead so far according to Human Rights Watch estimates…With elections scheduled soon afterwards hopefully things will improve again @-@@ but we shall see what happens then..

His character Ethel Moskowitz appeared previously as one of Wallace Fennel’s patients before his death offscreen after being diagnosed with brain tumors which were revealed throughout season three ("Mars vs Earth") until her final appearance where she dies while having dinner together with Clark Duke ('Ashley') just like Danny did when they had lunch together few weeks earlier.[[1]]During filming for this scene (and others), there are no tears shed because both actors could not cry without laughing or getting goose bumps due their good friendship outside set making it harder than usual.[2] This is also why it took them so long between scenes despite only two minutes passing within the show itself—they needed time away from each other in order create those moments authentically since they weren't used too often anymore even though Ashely still loved Veronica but couldn’ t tell anyone else about what happened inside him(even if he wanted). 

The original title idea came up shortly after completing " Weevils Wobble But They Don 't Go Down ". It was suggested by Executive Producer Phil Klemmer that we should have an episode dedicated to Mr Strong who died during production on March 30,  2014. The script takes place over four days and has many callbacks towards previous episodes such as “ Mars Investigations ” ,” Pasherazzi ",“ Midnight Marauders" etc., which make sense considering how much fun everyone involved seemed while shooting these particular sequences!

The schisma between those who opposed this ban became so deep it resulted in two competing groups within Congregational Beth Sholom : one led by Moses Glickstein, its president; another with Emanuel Cohen as leader ; both claiming title for themselves alone: they were called “ Beth She'an ” after their home town near Haifa Israel where many Jews lived during World War II when there wasn’t enough room on board ships taking refugee families out into safety across Europe . After much debate about what should happen next —including some threats against each other if either side didn’t give up control completely–both sides agreed not only would everyone stay put until further notice; but also nobody else could come back without written permission first!

In order for such a large undertaking by one church congregation it was necessary that there be some form or organization structure so that all members would know what their responsibilities were within this project; hence The Council on Social Concerns ( COSC ) came into being under Rev. Dr Paul Lillie ' s leadership who was also president at UUFRC during those years from September through December:
The council had its own budget which allowed them not only funding but access too many other resources including legal advice regarding international law issues like human rights violations etc., making sure they weren't breaking any laws when sending out volunteers abroad because these people could get arrested if found guilty! They provided support services where needed whether housing assistance after returning home again due back injury suffered while serving others overseas -or simply just someone listening sympathetically about how hard things have been lately... All told though thanks go largely down two individuals namely Revd Dr John Hickman & Reverend Mark Glasser whose names will forever remain etched inside every heartbeat taken away here today . It has truly made an impact upon us as well giving hope & courage beyond measure knowing we can do something good even in small ways right now together regardless of our circumstances whatever may arise tomorrow morning..

The First World War is remembered through many forms including memorial art works; museum collections; archives and recordings – these provide opportunities both on individual level but also collectively reflective or commemorative activities. In exploring different ways we can remember what happened during WWl there are challenges around how best inform people who want know more? There may well come times when someone wants details from those affected while others just wish peaceful reflection time alone without interruption so finding balance between memory keeping/preservation versus sharing stories isn’t always easy…

The IWGC has responsibility only for war cemeteries ; it does not maintain memorial crosses or other monuments erected at sites where burial is impossible owing either t o lack ot space or unsuitable soil conditions (see Chapter V ). It also cannot take over ownership from another authority if this involves financial liability; nor can it undertake new commissions when funds are insufficiently available : therefore there were no further British military cemetery com m issions after Passchendaele Ridge Ceme- try near Ypres had been completed late i n June l y'o '630 This decision may have reflected public opinion which did not favour spending money during wartime on remembrance projects such as memoria] crosses although one might expect more concern about those killed than survivors who later became disabled through injury , disease etc Since then however some exten sive work has taken place to restore many of these earlier casualties in France .

In addition three British Royal Air Force personnel killed while serving with Nocton Hall Flying Club before World War II rest here alongside five French volunteers that served under contract within this unit - although these latter individuals had been repatriated when peace returned they chose voluntarily stay behind rather than return home thus ensuring them eternal sleep close beside each other which can easily seen upon visitation should one decide so desire given its relatively low profile compared others dotted around Europe otherwise.[1]

> ter in July, which stated : " ...the Government hereby declare their desire for proper commemoration by memorial tablets or other means as may seem fit at such places outside British territory where members … have died whilst serving under His Majesty'... The decision reflected an awareness within government circles about difficulties experienced during World War II when trying establish who had been killed. At least one family suffered due solely on this matter - Captain David Porteous-Younger RNVR and his wife Daphne (nee Higginson) had lived in Burma prior moving into Singapore shortly after her father Sir Percy Sykes arrived as High Commisioner; she lost both parents while he went missing without trace only weeks later. In recognition they were awarded full military honours despite having no known grave site – there being none available locally because Japanese forces occupied Malaya & Thailand postwar until early ’50’so remains could not be recovered nor identification made!

### Sites maintained following decolonisation 1968–present day:
The United Kingdom retained responsibility over several former colonies including Hong Kong , Cyprus etc., however these sites became part of the CWGC network from April 24th',73'. This was largely due to pressure brought upon Britain through Commonwealth governments wanting more say regarding how their citizens are commemorated . It also meant that UK veterans would now enjoy equal status with those fighting alongside them back home instead feeling neglected or forgotten unlike before ! Furthermore, local authorities provided grants towards upkeep costs which allowed further expansion beyond existing boundaries such like Canada did during WWI/II when original funding ran out . These developments have continued since then too ; today we see countries all around world participating under one umbrella organisation called The Commission for World War I Burials Ltd (CWB).

A similar scheme was developed by New Zealand in Mayfair Cemetery after it became clear that there had been no attempt made since World war I [4] These are usually funded from a small charge levied at death upon families; this is known colloquially among undertakers 'familiars' due its long-standing history.
In addition some jurisdictions allow military burials outside their own territory ; examples include German Empire –WWI French Military Cemetary at Thiaucourt –French Revolutionary Wars/Napoleonic wars American Civil Buriel Place in France Polish Army Officers Memorial Site near Bayeux Poland - WWII Commonwealth War Grave Commissions cementery at Isigny Sur Mer Normandy-France Russian Soldiers Buriel Ground near Neuve Chapelle Northern Middlesex London UK Netherlands - Dutch East Indies Canadian Heroes Gravestone cemtery Arnhem Oosterbeek Holland The United States of America allows foreign nationals who served during wartime and died on US soil or while serving abroad under the command of USA authorities to be buried with full honors . This includes people such us former presidents John F Kennedy, Lyndon B Johnson , Ronald Reagan etc as well members Congressmen & Senators like Teddy Roosevelt Sr., Henry Cabot Lodge Jr..

The Commission does not commemorate civilians or merchant seamen . The main focus of its work is on those who died in service with their units during the war years and whose graves are either unknown (without a known grave) or unmaintained by governments as cemeteries .

In addition they can be named in separate national books and/or registers kept separately under different legislation than Armed Forces veteran's records. For example civilians killed due to bombing raids over Britain would not normally appear within any armed forces casualty lists unless their names were added manually later if it could be established with certainity (either through witness statements etc) that an individual had been involved with specific operations where there may have been losses suffered among civilian personnel present eithinadvertently bombed sites). A similar approach has also applied post-war when determining which members should receive medals awarded specifically towards British victims f first two world wars; these include awards like Silver Star Medal & Bronze Cross Medal but do NOT count toward anything beyond "meritorious" level decorations - no matter how impressive your record might otherwise seem!

On St Augustine's feast (28 May), I found myself elected archdeacon for Maidstone" However it is thought unlikely because there are no other records about him before being chosen bishop nor does Bede mention any meeting with Pope Gregory III or reference to papal approval which would have taken place if it were true ; also, such circumstances could not be ignored from someone who wrote extensively about events during their time

Jump up ^ Prattis & Wainwright p549–562; Kirby pp xvii - xxiii: "It appears by Simeon’s epitaph...that he died at a great age." Also 'Simeone Episcopus Cantuariensis' [Kingdom] is mentioned between Pope Stephen IIIs name and those Kings whom the bishops supported against Childebrand .

a-rIANS, nouns [from ARIA], those which end either in an or ium; hence opposed to ROMICONES, names ending -us : thus we distinguish between Arianae et Romani nominia. This distinction arose chiefly because women's names were sometimes made feminine after this fashion: as Propertius gives us Amarillis as one form among others that might be taken into account when thinking about prosody ; compare Lactantius Firmianu s De Institutione Oratoria I II VI VII IX X XI XXVI XXXII XIV XVII XVIII XIX etc., and Servius GEORGIKOS 305 ariani nomina = ariacorum vocabula (= nominibus), wherein we find an example of both forms: compare Aristotle Topics VIII III IX XIII XV XVI XXIV etc.. The more usual way however has been for men who did not wish their children 'to take the name', so called from its association w ith cuckolds —the very word being derived fr om latin quack —to adopt some other term like Cyprian or Crispin , while if they wished them still further away fro m Christianity then they would use such terms at least partly out o f respect fo r Christ (for the early Christians used these kinds oft en in honorific speech) .
In my opinion there is nothing wrong with ARIANS, but rather something good. As far back ago ca1498 , t he best-known poet of his day was Ariosto; this fact alone should make us think twice before using any one else's poetry as our standard reference point when discussing Latin literature!

All models had been commissioned into service before WW I came about; most remained operational until scrapped or lost during hostilities while some continued serving past World War II until sold outright as surplus stock items elsewhere around Europe where possible after much repairs made necessary due wear caused over decades spent patrolling local waters offshore areas outside mainland European nations borders such as those located within British territories like Gibraltar Island etcetera

Germany had no operational U -boats available for service on these shores until October, when three Type IIIB minelayers arrived from Kiel which could also be used as minisubs by diving while carrying a small number (six) torpedoes or mines each; they took part in operations against England during November. These units suffered severe casualties due both their unreliability underwater plus being captured early into action by Britain's Royal Naval Reserve Volunteer Fleet Mining Squadron(RNRVFS). From December several more type IID subminecraft went out with better results than those achieved earlier this year but still only two remained afloat at years end that saw them laid down again beginning January/February time period till March completion date which meant another month would pass before any new vessels launched ready operationally active duty fleet status commencing June same calendar quarter end months later after several weeks spent repairing damage sustained since previous engagement & rearmament task carried over & completed successfully .
The Germans were able to resume offensive actions using these craft shortly afterwards because even though many experienced crewmen died abruptly upon first deployment , others returned home alive  and quickly replaced them en masse so long story short is we had success rate increased exponentially within matter days now compared then .  
In order for submarines operating on the North Sea coast of Belgium not just Germany alone could take advantage, other countries such as France started building minisubs around mid-1915 too late however considering they did not have access either until April next following year when shipyard facilities began production phase accordingly thus allowing both nations collaborate effectively together against British forces defending their shores during second half 20th century respectively.

They displaced around one hundred twenty four metric ton s or over three thousand pounds; they carried small crews totalling upwards from ten men on average. Their engines produced speeds ranging as high as nineteen knots although British sources suggest that most attained only fifteen ; this would be slower when loaded down below water level with mines though this was not reported during wartime service - only surface speed is known officially after war's end where it seems many submarines could exceed eighteen miles per hour despite heavy loads underwater due primarily because these vessels lacked diving gear like other German models did have so all torpedoes must remain above deck once placed inside launchers upon commission into active duty

They were powered with two MAN six-cylinder petrol engines, which drove one screw each via an intermediate reduction gearbox to give them both better speed underwater compared to their diesel counterparts; they could do around five knots on electric motors alone at slow speeds such as when docking or manoeuvring through narrow passages. Their electrical systems used lead–acid batteries for storage purposes that provided enough charge for about eight hours' operation after being fully recharges from shore supply lines during nighttime operations where necessary before returning homeward into port again afterwards once mission completed successfully without fail despite heavy resistance encountered along way due many reasons including bad weather conditions etc..

The German Navy had originally envisioned that these would replace its aging fleet of UB II class coastal minelayers , however it soon became apparent that this could not happen due to problems concerning the length restriction imposed by international treaties, so instead they ordered additional Weser Class Coastal Minelanders which are similar except being power driven from diesels rather then electric motors like most WW I era U Boats where electrically propelled surface craft such as destroyer escorts or mine sweep ships while underwater submerged can use batterie technology developed during the war time years between both World Wars up until today’ s modern nuclear reactor fueled ballistic missile subs using fuel cells installed on board ship

The first keel plate read "For our Emperor Wilhelm" while that of her companion bore inscriptions relating to Archduke Franz Ferdinand's assassination ("To memory this boat was built"). Both completed their trials successfully despite having problems fitting their engines; both could attain a top speed underwater but struggled when surfaced due lacking sufficient power for dives over long distances without refuelling or resurfacing en route—a defect corrected during subsequent construction runs following lessons learned from earlier experiences operating these vessels within Kriegsmarine service operations off Western Europe prior World War I Armistice ending hostilities between Central Powers versus Entente Alliance Allies !

The third boat launched was the first of three boats built by Chatham at their own expense , named E40 . This vessel is notable because it marked a departure from previous practice, and made use of new technology. It did not have any steam boilers fitted; instead its power came entirely via electricity generated on board using batteries charged during surfaced operations with diesel engines turning generators to charge them up again as soon they ran out! When submerged these systems allowed longer periods below water than ever before possible for British subs – but also meant more weight had been added onto each craft so that there would be no risk if anything went wrong en route over

Another problem was corrosion due mainly because all pipework passed over side plates instead being submerged inside them thus leaving external surfaces exposed to saltwater spray with resultant leaks .

They would leave their base each morning around dawn arriving back after dark having carried out between five – eight attacks during daylight hours against shipping convoys along coastal areas where they had received intelligence information about enemy movements in advance. These raids often took place over several days covering large distances until they ran low upon fuel reserves forcing them homewards towards Germany before being refuelled again ready for another mission ahead; this process continued throughout summer months into early autumn when cold weather arrived making such operations impossible due lack warm clothing available among crews so instead most vessels remained moored up safely within sheltered harbours await next season arrival once more warmer conditions returned later year round cycle begins all over again!

The four submarines were ordered southwards with orders not to attack unless attacked first; however after waiting six hours without any contact or information regarding further movement in support their commander LtCdr Eckard Hennemann decided instead upon torpedo attacks under cover of darkness — orders which he then disobeyed completely when he ran his boat alongside Fredikstad shortly afterwards & fired her deck gun several times until she surrenderd !

The first operation took place at dawn on Sunday December 8th when two motor torpedo boats – HMS Mohawk &amp;quot;Mohican&amp;"&lt ;/a&gt;&lt;br / gt;&nbsp ; launched eight midget-submarine XE Craft - code named Operation FN43675X. The objective: To destroy or damage three ships moored off La Spezia harbour: SS _Ulster Prince_, _Alcantara_and_ Capo Orso_. All targets were missed although one crew member managed to penetrate into a dry dock before being captured by coastguardsmen who had been alerted early in advance that something unusual might be happening near their base! At least six other similar attempts followed but none proved successful either due lack equipment failure caused mainly through bad weather conditions which hampered visibility levels during daylight hours . On January2nd , however there was another attempt made with four more craft launching themselves out from Gibraltar towards Genoa port where they sank the Italian merchant ship Carlotta after ramming her hull several times while trying unsuccessfully again for about half an hour until finally giving up hope altogether ! In March 1941 came yet another attack involving nine submarines sent against Tripoli's naval facilities resulting only minor damages inflicted upon two cargo vessels anchoring nearby namely Tiger and Hercules respectively according reports filed back home afterwards once all boats returned safely having completed mission successfully without any casualties among crews involved thus far so good job done overall as always!!

These subterranean bays could accommodate upwards off 12,00O men at one time — which they did during World War II when thousands upon thousand s o f refugee Spaniards fled across into British territory. There is nothing secret about these caves nowadays : as part pf my tour I visited them myself ; but it would have been possible for all Germany's U -boats stationed near Malta (and even those that attacked shipping through Alexandria) to be refitted there undetected before being sent against Britain 's vital supply lines around Cape Town or South America ! But this story has yet another chapter—a remarkable one! It concerns some buildings constructed right inside Languard Bay inlandfrom Winston Churchill Avenue at Eastside Cemetery The Spanish authorities still maintain guard over these places today • They are indeed very impressive structures: two immense concrete blockhouses with thick walls measuring twelve feet high by sixteen wide built on top of each other; and then next door, another building twentyfeet long x eightwide where the workmen slept .
The whole area was surrounded by barbed wire entanglement enclosing a large compound containing several smaller watchtowers , three water tanks filled from an underground spring nearby serving drinkable freshwater supplies 24 hours daily plus ample storage space below ground level accessible only via ladders leading down from above-ground doors which were never opened except during working periods when guards patrolled outside.

At one point over half these men were taken away within three days ! However since then things have improved considerably due largely because we are now better organised than ever before which means less time spent travelling between different parts while still keeping our operational efficiency high enough not only keep us safe ourselves but also those around us too !! That said though I must admit some people seem more concerned with getting back quickly rather focussing solely upon protect themselves first & everything else secondarily - although admittedly perhaps this isn't always possible either way round ?? As such overall numbers continue dropping off gradually day-by-day resulting mostly likely ultimately towards complete evacuation sometime down line :-(

As a result many women left behind children who grew up without them, whilst they waited patiently at various ports across Europe before returning back after hostilities ceased. This was especially true when it came time being reunited once again - but this process proved far easier than what happened during previous conflicts where thousands upon tens remained separated forever because no one ever knew if any particular individual would return alive ! In addition there are still numerous stories passed down over generations about people whose last words spoke so vividly towards all involved; "Don’ t worry I will see you soon!" However sad these tales may sound today we should never forget how valuable life truly is which means making sure our loved ones feel safe wherever possible

It was decided that these should be admitted into Spain instead with no restriction on numbers or nationality although they could not all go at once so some had t o remain temporarily while others left for home as space became available elsewhere ( usually within two weeks ) There is little information concerning what happened after this date other than that most remained there until around March / April when arrangements started again between Gibraltar & Madrid. This time however rather than using ships directly berthed alongside it seems passengers travelled via Tangiers which made matters much easier since accommodation would already have been arranged prior too departure.. Once arrived back Home most families stayed together even though distance might separate them geographically because if one child went off then everyone else wanted something similar done!
There are records indicating how difficult life must'vebeen living abroad without family members close by but also evidence suggesting why people were willingto leave behind loved ones - whether outofnecessityor choice - during such trying times; perhapsjust knowingtheywere safe provided comfort enough

The Germans have made use of this situation and are now making great efforts towards rearmament on their side - particularly through industrial mobilisation – whilst maintaining complete secrecy as regards numbers or types o f weapons being produced but also as concerns actual weaponry deployment plans ! We must be prepared! This is why I am asking you again today: Are we ready? Is France's Navy fully operational ? If so how do our units compare with those currently deployed around us : Britain has recently increased its naval presence off Spain following increasing incidents involving Spanish ships; Italiy continues pushing forward ; Germany may try using submarines for attacks against British shipping routes (as happened last year)... All these things will require new tactics from yourselves-including mine mission preparation & execution skills in order ensure victory over potential enemy forces while keeping casualties low during combat operations @@@
Therefore please prepare yourself mentally/physically well beforehand because once battle commences nothing else matters anymore except winning by all means necessary including killing if required!! The time frame between 'now' where everyone starts thinking about what they should wear tomorrow morning until then remains unpredictable . However , based upon historical precedents there seems little doubt that something big happens within 48 hours after launch date... So get out there early enough to find the best spot available close proximity of town hall square just outside main entrance door steps...

The next day there followed an official announcement : " The Government has decided, with regret but after careful consideration following representations received yesterday evening regarding repatriation facilities for British children who have been interned since 1940 at Castelar Concentration Camp near San Sebastian, Spain ..." And then came this statement: "... A special train will leave Madrid tonight at midnight carrying about seventy-five persons including twenty-eight children under twelve years." As can well imagined those seven days had not passed quietly among our parents' friends whose sons or daughters could now come home - almost! But first they must return through France where no doubt their relatives waited anxiously ! It is perhaps worthwhile recording here what happened during these few hours on board ship between England ad nort hern Africa before returning across Europe via Switzerland into Germany itself . On arrival in Gibraltar it turned out that although all travel documents were correct some o f them did not comply wi th regulations concerning health matters and so no one except a handful of women (and two babies) plus thirty men over sixteen would be permitted to disembark until certain formalities had been completed by the medical officer. This meant that everyone else was accommodated temporarily aboard another vessel which remained moored alongside HMT Maidstone throughout Saturday night waiting patiently as its passengers slept fitfully , knowing full wel l how important each hour counted if any hope existed for further repatriations from Castelar Concentration Camp .
In fact after several fruitless attempts, permission came early Sunday morning when finally there arrived at last an order authorising departure with immediate effect; however this only applied within three days hence because more time might then elapse than originally intended due mainly towards achieving satisfactory clearance certificates involving vaccination records etc., Thus those

> 275 billets at each camp. In a reply dated Monday morning (July) morning his deputy replied that there were "a good many more" than they could accommodate without building new camps - but this was only one way out; another possibility would have been leaving these refugee families on board their own vessels until permanent housing arrangements are made available." These temporary facilities included three large tents erected alongside an existing tented village which housed some soldiers' wives who were expecting children soon after D Day. The tents also provided shelter during rainy periods or when wind blew hard enough against them so forcefully it threatened damage due its strength alone... They remained standing even though hurricane-force gusts knock down everything within reach!
The decision by Oliver Stanley not accept any further evacuation requests from Spain led Gibraltarian officials into contact with other European governments in search oi suitable places where victims might find sanctuary before being allowed back home again if necessary -- something no longer possible now because Britain had decided upon using military airfields instead? This resulted finally_in making @,@ 10,384 people homeless across Europe including those living under German rule and over half million+ Poles taken prisoner along Poland border areas . Some refugees fled east towards Ukraine while others moved west toward Greece hoping to cross the Aegean Sea en route Italy then onto North Africa via Algeria & Morocco but found themselves imprisonment camps once more; thus setting off another wave of migration that lasting well beyond war years ended only late sixties early seventy s ?

The others formed a separate group consisting mainly ot members o f families whose parents worked at HM Dockyard or elsewhere within Government service; they occupied two temporary wooden buildings erected behind St. Andrew's School near Trafalgar Cemetery —their meals provided by Messrs Green & Son butter merchants based nearby—and their supervision undertaken by Dr Ramsey-Jones together witb Miss Wadsworth his nurse ; all these arrangements proved unsatisfactory and it became apparent tha t there would have be no alternative if action for further repatriation did not occur immediately because many such "children" showed signs of malnutrition as well as emotional disturbance due partly to separation fr om family m embers which were becoming increasing frequent with each passing day .

A battalion from German troops in Spain would advance up either side of Monte Gorda (the rock's northernmost point) while Spanish soldiers invaded across an isthmus between Bayside Beach and Rosia Bay (at Europa Point). An amphibious landing at Sandycove Creek or Winston Churchill Avenue near Owen Roberts Airport might be attempted if necessary although this idea has been discounted since it could easily have failed because there are no suitable transportation links available nearby; most likely all supplies had to come overland via roadways already under construction when they were discovered during aerial surveys conducted before World War II began! In addition six submarines operating out-of -port should help secure any beachhead obtained after successfully crossing into British territory without suffering significant casualties themselves due mostly thanks their superior speed compared against slower vessels belonging other navies such Japan’S Imperial Navy whose ships usually did not exceed twelve knots maximum top speeds whereas U Boats reached nearly twenty five miles per hour making them much faster than those employed elsewhere around globe today

Fighters had been deployed for air defense against any RAF counterattacks which might occur over France itself - which then became a vital strategic point as well since it provided an excellent forward base from whence operations could easily extend into Egypt should that country fall under Axis domination again;
Nearly three years after this report, General George C Marshall, chief military adviser (1940) & later Secretary Of War ( 32nd U.S presidential term ) commented : " If we lose Malta [the island is less important today because our supply lines are now more secure] I believe America can win no war". It must have taken quite some courage back in those days when most people thought Hitler invincible !
The idea has come up several times recently at least two of them involving Malta's current Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi: one suggestion being made last year during a visit here , another coming out earlier this month while Mr G was meeting with EU officials about plans he wants put together to transform Europe’s energy market using natural gas supplies and renewable sources such as solar power . The latter proposal would involve building huge floating platforms off coastal areas where they wouldn't interfere much either way but still allow plenty sunlight through so homes nearby don`t get too hot ; these things tend towards producing electricity rather than just storing excess heat though which might be useful depending upon circumstances - especially if there were any kind of emergency situation going on elsewhere! As far as what else goes down well?

Additionally, other sources also imply that there is little reason for doubt regarding this part : Eutropia had long nurtured an ambition her son might share; she knew well how unstable imperial rule could be after a short time, so why should they wait until a new emperor came along? She must therefore decide whether or not one existed who deserved loyalty—and if no such person did exist then what steps needed taking next (Platner). This passage provides insight into both Eutropias character as someone willing go far beyond normal political boundaries when presented with opportunity.

The Roman Emperor Domitian was assassinated in September AD81 by members within his own household following months-long intrigue among high ranking officials close enough around court circles where plots hatched secretly away from public view without fear being exposed . One man accused later turned out innocent , but many others were caught redhandedly guilty upon questioning - including several important figures already mentioned earlier: Nerva's wife and two children included him too!

He also promised heirs for their sons, a privilege denied by previous emperors including Titus (who caused many families great grief). This move increased support from those members within high society. For example Tacfarinas' son-in-law Annius Maximus became Prefecture Superior at Rome around this time whilst another family member Quintilius Var held command over one legion near Misenum with assistance given under orders issued directly from Emperor Trajan later down into Africa Proconsularis province where they remained until c AD120 when Lucius Munatiucus Gallicani defeated them once again after having done so on behalf off Caesar Aelius Hadrian back then earlier too !  ********************** Previous Empresses include Livia Drusa and Julia Servilla but she did not rule herself as her husband Gaiussaeptiminius Laetinus died shortly afterwards in 97 CE while still living together with these women both being widowed respectively - thereafter becoming co consuls alongside each other ever since!
Nevertheless Domitian had been forced to abdicate due largely because it was felt that his reign lacked legitimate succession which occurred during the first century BCE however; following Julius Ceasars death he appointed himself "Princeps" or First Citizen for life (notwithstanding many claims made against him). This move proved successful enough even though some historians dispute whether Nerva actually succeeded solely based upon circumstance alone rather than merits achieved through hard work & determination thus giving birth unto a new era within Roman history itself known simply by its title 'The Flavian Dynasty'.

To gain favor with certain members of the upper class, however, one or two appointments are recorded among them: a former praetor named Seius Sallustius became consul for AD82; another prominent man from Caesar's circle was Gaius VibiuSaturninus (consul) ; he served briefly at about age thirty-five before being murdered soon afterward along with four other Senators involved against him.

This gift caused some resentment because those who did not benefit were very much aware they would be excluded if another civil war broke out ; nevertheless there is no evidence any rebellion took place following Nervas death nor is their record mention even an attempt made towards rebelling during these times when things seemed most chaotic.. His successor Trajan continued paying similar sums until cessations began after only eight years into reign; however neither he nor later Emperors found themselves forced back again upon new schemes for raising taxes against willful citizens living under military rule since now Rome enjoyed its first real peace in centuries thanks largely due efforts put forth during previous periods wherein significant improvements had been achieved through careful planning combined skilfull implementation followed strict enforcement laws which ensured every citizen remained loyal unless otherwise instructed by higher authorities!

While Mithridates IV Eupator rebelled against Trajan and Sulla Gnaeus Pompey Magnentius declared himself Emperor, claiming he had been adopted or designated as successor upon entering office earlier than expected - thereby riding out most potential opposition within Rome itself before any such claims could be made. His son-in-law Marcellinus also supported him initially; however after making sure their families were securely established back home they both joined forces under Tigidacum Iulus Priscus who took over control when it appeared there would not be enough money left even if everything went according plan anyway due largely because too many people wanted something extra special instead just whatever regular payments already given them may have provided otherwise! As always happens whenever anything important goes wrong though no one ever seems willing admit fault afterwards so all blame ends up being laid squarely down shoulders those involved originally didn’t matter whether innocents guilty alike simply result more chaos ensues until things eventually settle themselves naturally again… At first Domitian seemed like an ideal choice to succeed Nerva , but his own ambitions proved far greater . He started off by having the Senate proclaim that he was now a god (something never done for anyone other then Augustus) while simultaneously declaring war on Parthia in order force Mithridates IV Eupator into submission . This led directly towards deaths of thousands Romans including entire legions stationed along Danube River which had been sent south during winter months as part precaution against potential invasion from north

In light that some senators might be displeased about their loss from power (their number being reduced) due not only deaths but also retirement caused mainly through age or illness they made up an agreement between them whereby any one among these could come forward if accused wrongfully when no evidence existed against him; this rule applied even though it meant bringing down another person's name along too – just so long however none else came forth claiming innocence after having been convicted already!

> reign is provided by Herodian whose main source appears to have been one or more official biographies composed during that time. Historians differ as regards whether these works were produced under, with and /or before imperial patronage : cf. Southern (1984) pp xi – xxviii who argues they may well date from Hadrian' s era while Bingham - Shaw argue there are reasons why such documents would be unlikely post-dating Hadrians reign see p305 f n76 ) It should also not go unnoticed how often Herodian refers back at length over several chapters into an earlier section covering events leading up through Gordien I & II: e g chapter XXVIII 2 ff " For it had long ago become evident that a crisis in public affairs could only come about when those who held power became insolent because their position was secure" ; Chapter XXXIV Introduction "...at which point he [Trajan] recalled all his army officers home for discharge; but then having restored them again without any other purpose than sheer complacency...".
This suggests some sort compilation on Trajans accession might already exist , although no evidence exists today .
Aside this , the sole surviving contemporary reference is Tacitus ' Annals XV XLII where Nerva receives praise as the first of Rome 's emperors to have deliberately chosen and appointed another man before himself dying : thus indicating either no sense or concern with dynastic succession (as after him) or perhaps more likely, much like modern monarchies (such as England), a practice established by custom rather than law. Moreover since most historians agree these writings were composed shortly afterwards around A D109 – see Bingham-Shaw pp xv -xviii etc there would seem little reason

Accordingly, there is no account at all for why or how this occurred ; it merely says that a change had taken place from one emperor (Domiziano ) to another ("from Dominitian into other hands" ). In addition many scholars consider Suetonious' glowing description biased toward Calpurnia Pisonis favorites; therefore some scholars dismiss these accounts entirely while others use them cautiously alongside less partial sources such as those found within official records written after each individual rule began including tablets uncovered during archaeological excavations around Rome itself which date back several hundred years prior when they first came under power themselves through various means ranging between military conquest & diplomatic alliances formed over time until finally culminating into what we know today collectively known simply "the Roman Republic".

In fact there is no evidence whatsoever which suggests that either senators themselves ever attempted to exercise such powers through their own agency nor would they necessarily be inclined towards doing so if given an opportunity. It appears therefore unlikely whether one could reasonably expect much more than token support amongst these members when considering how things stood at present within Rome itself...

Peter Ostrum eventually took on what ultimately proved an ill -fated part which led him down paths involving drugs & alcohol abuse later that year – though this did not prevent him from being cast again just months prior!   In late March / April timeframe following some legal wrangling over rights issues between MGM Studios And its distributor United Artists Corp., filmmaker Martin Scorsese stepped into negotiations regarding his own version Of A Poolhall Junkie Screenplay written By Walter Hill alongside David Saperstein who was already working On revisions based off original script drafts submitted To them earlier during same period .

The movie received generally negative reviews from critics at its initial release; Bosley Crowther wrote "It's a very routine gangster story" but praised Robert Ryan as an actor who had been given little opportunity since World War II ; Jack Kroll said it displayed "all [Rossen'] tricks — humorlessness (Fast Times At Ridgemont High ), ponderous metaphor ("Maltese Falcon"), plodding symbolism ('Thieves Like Us'), self-conscious poetry ... which all tend toward maudlin sentimentality"; Stanley Kauffmann called most characters too flatly drawn or poorly acted while also criticizing lengthy scenes and what seemed like padding. However John McCarten found parts funny despite their obvious flaws in construction: "... it has plenty going for itself." Frank Rich did find fault with both Rossen's direction -- saying he failed to show how Fast Eddie could change into a cold killer capable of murdering even someone close --and Newman himself whom Richard Schickel later described as having played the part rather unbelievably .

For some interior shots including one with Paul Newman playing billards against Wade Miller, they employed Jake LaMotta; he played himself while pretending not to know who it really was : Paul! In addition there were many other cameo appearances such as Charles Bronson doing security guard duty outside Mario Puzo’ s office building where Rossen got permission before making any phone calls or taking pictures inside his offices without being caught ; Eddy Barclay & family watching their son perform live from Paris via satellite during this production period when our hero wasn't available due again soon after finishing work here but still able attend another event somewhere else since we hadn’ t yet learned how best utilize each other time away together..
The Hustler opened at Radio City Music Hall in January 1960 under its original title , Pool Shark – which had been rejected because audiences might think that meant something different than what actually happened within those walls . A few months later though following positive reviews and word-of -mouth recommendations among friends families colleagues etc., Universal Pictures decided rebranding would help promote awareness about this film so now instead people just call them “Hustlers” !!!

 Several shots are also presented with objects placed strategically within them. In particular there are several instances where items such as bottles, flowers or even animals (a bird) appear at crucial points during scenes which function both visually - they often complement key dialogue - whilst symbolising elements from earlier scenes that relate directly back into context for later events. One particularly interesting use occurs after an early scene between Pauline [Sarah]and her lover Guy Morton played by Jack Haley Jr., who asks "Will you marry me?" They then kiss passionately on top steps before walking off screen towards their car parked outside Aunt Kate's house; immediately afterwards we see four white roses lying across stairs leading downstairs followed shortly afterwards by Paulines husband arriving home unexpectedly- clearly implying betrayal amongst other things: The following exchange takes place moments prior to these actions happening:- GUY : You wanna be married? PAULINE [ SARAH ] Yes! I do...I want it all so much....Guy and i will have our own little nest together..where no one can touch us anymore ..we 'll start a new life ...just the two of US.....it won t matter what anyone else thinks !!! GOOD NEWS ??? AUNT KATE : It s just wonderful , darling!!! Paulette !! How nice of your father to bring you here at such short notice . But please come upstair ( she leads them onto balcony ) where there are better views from which they could watch fireworks display that was planned for later in evening.
The use or placement within shots is often very effective as well - especially when combined with dialogue (either verbalised or not) In some cases this also includes animals like dogs cats etc who may appear out doors during certain scenes but then again disappear entirely until next time

> visages that stand between himself and this goal."   In his book A Pocket Guide To Film Analysis (2014) David Bordwell suggests several themes which run through all three sections. These are: class conflict, betting culture as an addiction; desire for fame versus love/friendship ; fate or chance vs personal responsibility ; competition /individualism v co-operation/community values - see table below right    He also notes how much time has passed since we last saw characters from section one – ten years plus by part four.    The Hustler opens with Paul Newman' s character asserting some basic facts regarding money (" I can win you everything ... if my luck holds out ") then announcing "...but first let me tell ya who I am ". This sets up our expectations that there will be many challengers before him on route towards success in life at any cost

It would seem reasonable therefore to conclude perhaps surprisingly given its title ?that it isn’t so much 'the hustlers" themselves whose actions drive these events along . It seems rather more likely instead than they have been merely caught within a social context , their individual motivation being less important here because of the way Rossen structures this story around these recurring conflicts between different types people and ways of living   , his plot having little concern about whether Fast Eddie actually wins those games he plays (in fact sometimes loses) but simply shows us all sorts interesting things happen when humans interact together, including murder !(see also: "The Godfather") ; or like Scorsese's Taxi Driver - focus solely upon our main protagonist/antagonists inner thoughts & emotions alone without really caring too greatly how this impacts upon others beyond them directly involved    The H

The New York Times - Hal Hinson (28 November 1974)
In fact, I don’t think there are any great movies about women making it big unless they also show how much pain comes with success — which makes them even more important because most people need help dealing with failure and disappointment just as badly if not worse then getting ahead. So while All About Eve might be considered timeless for its insight into human nature—and certainly deserves credit for being brave enough back when Hollywood was still very conservative indeed–I would argue that Sunset Boulevard is truly universal since everyone knows what happens after you reach your goal; whether by accident or hard work doesn’t matter: eventually something else will come along! But unlike other films where characters seem happy despite their problems(like Casablanca),this one shows us why happiness isn&apos;T always possible regardless who wins out in life…because sometimes winners lose too !!!!!!?????

However after watching De Niro play Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese’‘ s Taxi Driver(1975), He believed there would be no better actor to take on Sinatra than Robert deNiro playing Jake LaMotta_. The movie had been released only two weeks before Martin sent him into production himself by making Mean Streets_(the first film under their new joint venture)and within days they were shooting The King Of Comedy.___^

Variety called it "...an uncommonly good drama ..." in an era when many dramas were either over-sentimental or too graphically violent; noted critic Pauline Kael also remarked on this unusual quality : "(T)he stars aren’t doing anything except playing themselves against each other—and if you know what makes them tick (and I think we do), then their games are fascinating because these people don’t seem like actors at all but just guys who play pool professionally..."
